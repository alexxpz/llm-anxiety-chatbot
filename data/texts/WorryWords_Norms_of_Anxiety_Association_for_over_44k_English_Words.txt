Abstract
Anxiety, the anticipatory unease about a
potential negative outcome, is a common
and beneficial human emotion.
However,
there is still much that is not known, such
as how anxiety relates to our body and how
it manifests in language. This is especially
pertinent given the increasing impact of
anxiety-related disorders.
In this work, we
introduce WorryWords, the first large-scale
repository of manually derived word–anxiety
associations for over 44,450 English words.
We show that the anxiety associations are
highly reliable. We use WorryWords to study
the relationship between anxiety and other
emotion constructs, as well as the rate at
which children acquire anxiety words with
age. Finally, we show that using WorryWords
alone, one can accurately track the change of
anxiety in streams of text. The lexicon enables
a wide variety of anxiety-related research in
psychology, NLP, public health, and social
sciences. WorryWords (and its translations to
over 100 languages) is freely available.

Introduction
Anxiety is the apprehensive uneasiness or nervous-
ness due to some anticipated or potential negative
outcome. Even though it is often considered to be
an unwanted and negative feeling, psychologists
have long posited its evolutionary benefits. As a
species, we have benefited from feeling anxious:
for example, building safe dwellings to avoid being
attacked by wild animals and poisonous insects,
being respectful and kind to others to avoid social
exclusion, and so on (Bateson et al., 2011). Yet,
there is much we do not know such as the mecha-
nisms of how anxiety develops in our bodies and
mind, how normal and clinical anxiety manifest in
language, and effective mechanisms to cope with
excessive anxiety. Further, the dramatic technologi-
cal advances over the last few decades have rapidly
and substantially changed our environments to such
an extent (for instance, the widespread social me-
dia usage and human–technology interactions) that
there is now a considerable mismatch between the
current environment and what our anxiety response
slowly evolved to address over millennia (Blease,
2015; Salecl, 2004; Qureshi-Hurst, 2022). This has
led some to argue that we are in an ‘age of anxiety’
(Parish, 2000; Blease, 2015).
Anxiety has always been a part of normal hu-
man life. Some might feel anxious occasionally
and in particular circumstances (state anxiety), and
some might have a more diffuse sense of general
anxiety over long periods of time (trait anxiety).
Some of the major sources of anxiety include tests,
sports, technology, and social anxiety (Zeidner and
Matthews, 2010). More recently researchers have
also identified a growing amount of climate change
anxiety (Clayton, 2020). Mental health practition-
ers clinically diagnose anxiety disorders when the
sense of anxiety is so high or so frequent that it im-
pacts the day-to-day functioning of an individual.
In the US alone, 6.8 million adults (3.1% of the
population) are believed to have Generalized Anxi-
ety Disorder (GAD), 15 million adults (7.1%) have
Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), 7.7 million adults
(3.6%) suffer from Post-traumatic Stress Disorder
(PTSD), and everyone experiences stress from time
to time.1 Anxiety disorders are highly co-morbid
with depression (Kalin, 2020), and together they
constitute the internalizing disorders.
In addition to impacting well-being and happi-
ness, anxiety (both normal and clinical) has been
shown to impact cognitive outcomes such as learn-
ing, accurately performing tasks, productivity, as
well as our physical bodies (Kim and Gorman,
2005). In contrast, calmness (being in a state of
peace and tranquility) has been shown to improve
health and cognitive outcomes (Siddaway et al.,
1https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/facts-statistics
arXiv:2411.03966v1  [cs.CL]  6 Nov 2024

2018). Siddaway et al. (2018) also show the impor-
tance of conceptualizing anxiety as a continuum
from high calmness to high anxiety; and that both
promoting calmness and decreasing excessive anxi-
ety are important for overall health and well-being.
Thus, anxiety and calmness are active areas of re-
search in Psychology, Medicine, Public Health, So-
cial Science, Economics, and even the Humanities.
As is the case with many emotions, people ex-
press anxiety through language (consciously and
unconsciously). In this work, we study how anxi-
ety and calmness are associated with word mean-
ing. We asked over a thousand respondents to rate
44,450 English words on a scale from −3 (associ-
ated with high calmness) to +3 (associated with
high anxiety). We aggregated the responses to cre-
ate a word–anxiety association lexicon that has a
real-valued anxiety score for each of the words. We
refer to this resource by the name WorryWords. We
show that the scores in WorryWords are highly reli-
able (a split-half reliability score of 0.82, which is
in-line with scores for existing resources for other
emotions). We use WorryWords to study how anxi-
ety is related to other emotion constructs (valence,
arousal, dominance, fear, anger, sadness, etc.). We
show the rate at which anxiety and calmness words
are acquired with age. Finally, we show that Wor-
ryWords can be used with simple word-counting
methods to accurately track anxiety in text streams.
We make WorryWords, and its translations in
over 100 languages, freely available for research
through the project home page.2 Some areas where
we envisage its use include:
1. Understanding anxiety and the underlying
mechanisms; how anxiety relates to other emo-
tions; how it relates to our body; how anxi-
ety changes with age, socio-economic status,
weather, green spaces, etc.
2. Determining how anxiety manifests in lan-
guage; how language shapes anxiety; how cul-
ture shapes the language of anxiety; etc.
3. Tracking the degree of anxiety towards targets
of interest such as climate change, govern-
ment policies, biological vectors, etc.
4. Identifying effective coping mechanisms and
clinical interventions to manage anxiety.
5. Developing automatic systems for detecting
anxiety; developing chat systems that are sen-
sitive to nuances and diverse expressions of
anxiety by people from various demographics.

6. Studying anxiety and uneasiness in story
telling; its relationship with central elements
of narratology such as conflict and resilience.
7. Studying how anxiety impacts social be-
haviour in physical and virtual environments.
We also created an extensive list of ethical consid-
erations (Section 9) that must be taken into consid-
eration when using WorryWords.

Related Work
It is generally agreed that the three primary di-
mensions of affect (our sense of feeling) are
valence (positiveness–negativeness / pleasure–
displeasure), arousal (active–passive), and dom-
inance (dominant–submissive) (Russell, 1980; Os-
good et al., 1957). There is also work showing
that certain categorical emotions such as joy, anger,
and fear are particularly important (Ekman, 1992;
Plutchik, 1980). More recent work shows that we
construct and label these emotions (a cognitive pro-
cess) in our minds from various interoceptive sig-
nals (internal signals from our body to the brain)
(Barrett, 2017).
Anxiety is often considered a low-valence, high-
arousal, and low-dominance emotion, but there
is little work empirically exploring the degree to
which it is correlated with these affective dimen-
sions. Anxiety is also often compared to fear, but
unlike fear which generally tends to be a reaction
to a threat from the present (something that has
already manifested), anxiety is often associated
with the possible negative outcome of a future
event (Bateson et al., 2011). Anxiety and stress
are sometimes used synonymously and they are
generally agreed to be very close emotions (both
impact mind and body through excessive worrying,
loss of sleep, etc.), although stress is often associ-
ated with some physical stimulus and stress can be
one of the causes of anxiety.
Manually created word–emotion association lex-
icons exist for valence, arousal, and dominance
(Warriner et al. (2013) and Mohammad (2018a) for
English; Moors et al. (2013) for Dutch, and Võ et al.
(2009) for German). The largest among these is the
NRC VAD lexicon (Mohammad, 2018a, 2024a):
version 1 has entries for over 20,000 English words,
and version 2 for over 44,000 unigrams and 10,000
bigrams (two-word sequences). The NRC Emotion
Lexicon (Mohammad and Turney, 2010) is a popu-
lar lexicon for categorical emotions; it has entries
for over 14,000 English words.

We do not know of existing large lexicons for
anxiety; however, there exist some datasets of so-
cial media posts manually annoatated with anxiety
or stress labels. Rastogi et al. (2022) collected and
annotated about 5,488 Reddit posts with the labels
0 (no stress) and 1 (stress). Mitrovi´c et al. (2024)
collected a series of questions and answers from
Quora and Reddit, where the question contained
the term ‘anxiety’. Turcan and McKeown (2019)
created a dataset of 4000 5-sentence segments from
Reddit annotated for presence or absence of stress.
These social media datasets were compiled primar-
ily to train and test automatic systems that attempt
to detect anxiety from text. For details on automatic
anxiety detection, we refer the interested readers to
Mitrovi´c et al. (2024); Shen and Rudzicz (2017);
Rastogi et al. (2022); Winata et al. (2018). More
recent work interviewed volunteers and analyzed
their responses to identify language features such
as the use of personal pronouns, negations, and
emotion words with anxiety (Stade et al., 2023).
As part of the WorryWords Project, we created
a large word–anxiety association lexicon with a
focus on reliable annotations.3 We used existing
emotion lexicons to examine how anxiety is related
to other emotions. We also made use of a the Ras-
togi et al. (2022) dataset to show the usefulness of
WorryWords in tracking anxiety in text streams.

Obtaining Human Ratings of Anxiety
The keys steps in creating the anxiety dataset were:
1. selecting the terms to be annotated
2. developing the questionnaire
3. developing measures for quality control (QC)
4. annotating terms on a crowdsource platform
5. discarding data from outlier annotators (QC)
6. aggregating data from multiple annotators to
determine the anxiety association scores
We describe each of these steps below.
1. Term Selection. To allow for the study of anxi-
ety with respect to other affectual and linguistically
interesting properties, we included terms from: the
NRC Emotion Lexicon (Mohammad and Turney,
2013, 2010), the NRC VAD Lexicon (Mohammad,
2018a), and the terms from the Prevalence dataset
(Brysbaert et al., 2019) (specifically, words marked
as being known to over 70% of the respondents).
Summary details of each of these is provided in the
Appendix. The union of the above sets resulted in
3In follow on work, we also compiled anxiety association
norms for over 10K English phrases (Mohammad, 2024b).
44,450 terms that were then annotated for associa-
tion with anxiety and calmness.
2. Anxiety Questionnaire. The questionnaires
used to annotate the data were developed across
two rounds of pilot annotations. Detailed direc-
tions, including notes directing them to consider
predominant word sense (in case the word is
ambiguous) and example questions (with suitable
responses) were provided. (See Appendix.) The
primary instruction and the question presented to
annotators is shown below.
Consider anxiety to be a broad category that includes:
jittery, antsy, insecure, nervous, unease, tense, worried,
unnerving, nerve-racking, apprehensive, fretful, troubled,
self-doubting, discontented, concerned, and keyed up
Consider calmness to be a broad category that includes:
calm, relaxed, comforted, serene, at ease, self-assured,
carefree, composed, collected, untroubled, peaceful,
contented, unconcerned, indifferent, and uninvolved
Select the options that most English speakers will agree with.
Q1. <term> is often associated with feeling:
3: very anxious
-1: slightly calm
2: moderately anxious
-2: moderately calm
1: slightly anxious
-3: very calm
0: not associated with feeling anxious or calm
3. Quality Control Measures. About 2% of the
data was annotated beforehand by the authors and
interspersed with the rest. These questions are
referred to as gold (aka control) questions.
Half of the gold questions were used to provide
immediate feedback to the annotator (in the form
of a pop-up on the screen) in case they mark them
incorrectly. We refer to these as popup gold. This
helps prevent the situation where one annotates a
large number of instances without realizing that
they are doing so incorrectly. It is possible, that
some annotators share answers to gold questions
with each other (despite this being against the
terms of annotation). Thus, the other half of the
gold questions were also separately used to track
how well an annotator was doing the task, but for
these gold questions no popup was displayed in
case of errors. We refer to these as no-popup gold.
4. Crowdsourcing. We setup the anxiety annota-
tion task on the crowdsourcing platform, Mechan-
ical Turk. In the task settings, we specified that
we needed annotations from ten people for each
word. We obtained annotations from native speak-
ers of English residing around the world. Anno-
tators were free to provide responses to as many
terms as they wished. The annotation task was
approved by our institution’s review board.

both Spearman rank and Pearson’s correlations (last two columns), indicate high reliability.
Figure 1: Distribution of terms in WorryWords: per-
centage of terms associated with each class. (The total
number is shown in parenthesis.)
Demographics: About 87% of the respondents
who annotated the words live in USA. The rest
were from India, United Kingdom, and Canada.
The average age of the respondents was 38.9
years. Among those that disclosed their gender,
about 54% were female and about 45% were male.4
5. Filtering. If an annotator’s accuracy on the gold
questions (popup or non-popup) fell below 80%,
then they were refused further annotation, and all
of their annotations were discarded (despite being
paid for). See Table 1 for summary statistics.
6. Aggregation. Every response was mapped to
an integer from -3 (very calm) to 3 (very anxious).
The final anxiety score for each term is simply the
average score it received from each of the anno-
tators. We also created a categorical version of
the lexicon by labeling all words that got a score
≥2.5 as associated with high anxiety, ≥1.5 and
< 2.5 as moderate anxiety, ≥0.5 and < 1.5 as
slight anxiety, > −0.5 and < 0.5 as neither anxi-
ety nor calmness, and so on. We refer to the list of
words along with their real-valued final scores and
categorical labels as the WorryWords Lexicon.
Table 6 in the Appendix shows example entries
from the lexicon. Figure 1 shows the distribution
of the different classes. As expected, most words
are associated with neither anxiety nor calmness
(∼60%), but it is worth noting that about 27% of
the words are associated with anxiety (to some
degree) and about 13% of the words are associated
with calmness (to some degree).
4Respondents were shown optional text boxes to disclose
their demographic information as they choose; especially im-
portant for social constructs such as gender, in order to give
agency to the respondents and to avoid binary language.

Reliability of the Annotations
A useful measure of quality is the reproducibility
of the end result—repeated independent manual an-
notations from multiple respondents should result
in similar scores. To assess this reproducibility, we
calculate average split-half reliability (SHR) over
1000 trials.5 All annotations for an item are ran-
domly split into two halves. Two separate sets of
scores are aggregated, just as described in Section 3
(bullet 6), from the two halves. Then we determine
how close the two sets of scores are (using a metric
of correlation). This is repeated 1000 times and the
correlations are averaged. The last two columns
in Table 1 show the results (split half-reliabilities).
Scores of 0.82 (Spearman rank correlation) and
0.89 (Pearson correlation) indicate high reliability
of the real-valued scores obtained from the anno-
tations. (For reference, if the annotations were
random, then repeat annotations would have led to
an SHR of 0. Perfectly consistent repeated annota-
tions lead to an SHR of 1.)
If the real-valued scores are converted to discrete
categories (for example, into 3, 7, or 10, classes),
then we can make use of another measure of reli-
ability that factors in the classes. For example, if
we just want three classes: associated with anxiety,
associated with calmness, and neither. Then one
could simply split the -3 to 3 range into three equal
partitions of -3 to -1 (calmness), -1 to 1 (neither),
and 1 to 3 (anxiousness). To determine reliability
of the discrete labels obtained from annotations,
we first randomly split all annotations into two
halves (just as before). Now, if scores for a term x
obtained from the two halves place x in different
classes (e.g., if the two scores are 0.36 and 1.72),
then this contributes to a lower overall reliability.
In contrast, even if the scores for x from the two
halves vary a bit, but both scores place x in the
same class (e.g., if the two scores are 1.82 and
1.79) then this contributes to a higher overall reli-
ability. Thus we can compute reliability from the
extent to which the two halves of annotations result
in the same discrete class. We will refer to this as
the Split-Half Class Match Percentage (SHCMP).
5SHR is a common way to determine reliability of re-
sponses to generate scores on an ordinal scale (Weir, 2005).

and Split-Half Closeness Percentage (SHCloseP) ob-
tained from the anxiety annotations when splitting the
-3 to 3 score range into equal-sized bins (partitions) per-
taining to ordinal classes. SD: standard deviation.
Note, however, that using discrete classes means
that many items that have similar real-valued scores
from two independent sets of annotations may be
on different sides of a class boundary. Thus even if
the original annotations are reliable, using discrete
classes adds some unreliability inherently. To get a
sense of this, we also calculate the degree to which
the split-half scores are close to each other (without
regard to class boundaries): e.g., the percentage of
times two independent sets of annotations for an
item lead to scores that are closer than a pre-chosen
threshold (0.1, 0.25, etc.). We will call this the
Split-Half Closeness Percentage (SHCloseP).
Table 2 shows the SHCMP and SHCloseP for the
WorryWords annotations for various levels of gran-
ularity (#classes). The second column shows the
class size—obtained by dividing the -3 to 3 range
equally by #classes.6 The third column shows the
expected SHCMP when terms are given scores at
random. The fourth column shows SHCMP when
using the actual WorryWords annotations. The fifth
column shows SHCloseP when using different bin
sizes as threshold.
Observe that the SHCMP scores are markedly
higher than what one would get with just random
annotations. Further, SHCMP scores are fairly high
in case of a small number of discrete classes (bins),
but drops off markedly as the number of classes is
increased. Note the considerably higher SHCloseP
scores which indicate that much of the unreliability
in discrete classes is due to items falling on either
side of class boundaries, and that when there is a
class mismatch the involved classes are close to
each other (smaller error) as opposed to distant
classes (bigger error).
6SHCMP can also be determined from custom ranges that
are not of the same size. Here we show SHCMP with equal
size bins for simplicity.

WorryWords: Research & Applications
WorryWords has a wide variety of uses and appli-
cations as listed in the Introduction. We explore:
• Two diverse examples where lexicographic
analysis of the words helps answer research
questions about anxiety (Section 6).
• An example (with evaluation) of how the Wor-
ryWords can be used to accurately track anxi-
ety in text streams (Section 7). This has both
commercial and research applications.

Using WorryWords to Answer Research
Questions about Anxiety
6.1
From a lexical standpoint, how is anxiety
related to other emotions?
An important question in understanding any emo-
tion is how it relates to other emotions. With the
creation of the first large-scale lexicon of word–
anxiety associations, we can now study how these
norms correlate with other key emotion constructs
such as valence (V), arousal (A), and dominance
(D), as well as categorical emotions such as sad-
ness, fear, and anger. Since anxiety is commonly
understood to be a negative (low-valence emotion),
we expect it to have a negative correlation with
valence (negative situations are often associated
with anxiety). However, we have no prior evidence
to indicate how strong this negative correlation is
expected to be; especially since, there can be many
term pairs w1 and w2 such that even though w1
has lower valence than w2, w2 is associated with
a higher degree of anxiety than w1. For example,
hopeless and frenzy, lethargic and public speaking,
weak and test, etc.
Similarly, we expect anxiety to have a positive
correlation with arousal (since high anxiety terms
are also expected to be high arousal terms), and a
negative correlation with dominance (since higher
anxiety tends to co-occur with situations of loss of
control). Yet, again, it is unclear how strong these
correlations truly are across a vast vocabulary of
words. Understanding these relationships has impli-
cations in psycholinguistics and lexical semantics:
e.g., whether anxiety moderates word recognition
even when controlling for valence. Further, in the
context of lexicon-creation: If the magnitudes of
these correlations are very high, then one can sim-
ply take an existing VAD lexicon, and keep only the
low valence, high arousal, and/or low dominance
terms to create an anxiety lexicon.

Table 3: Spearman rank correlations of association
scores between various emotion pairs, for 44k terms.
VAD: The first row (and also the first column) of Ta-
ble 3 shows the correlations of anxiety association
scores of terms in WorryWords with the valence,
arousal, and dominance scores of terms in the NRC
VAD Lexicon v2 (Mohammad, 2024a). Observe
that anxiety has a moderate negative correlation
with valence, a mild correlation with arousal, and
a mild negative correlation with dominance. For
additional context, the bottom 3 rows (and last 3
columns) of Table 3 show the pair-wise correla-
tions between valence, arousal, and dominance. It
shows for example, that valence and dominance
tend to be more correlated than any of the other
pairs (a result also seen in other VAD lexicons such
as the Warriner Lexicon (2013)); and in terms of
the magnitude, the degree of (negative) correlation
between valence and anxiety is lower than that of
valence and dominance.
We also created an interactive visualization that
shows the WorryWords terms on valence–arousal
and valence–dominance spaces (Figure 8 in the
Appendix shows a screenshot). (Hovering over in-
dividual points shows the corresponding term as
well as anxiety, V, A, and D scores.) We observe
that, as expected, a majority of the anxiety words
(score > 0.5) occur in the top-left quadrant of the
V–A space: low V and high A. Nonetheless, there
are still non-negligible number of terms that oc-
cur in the top-right quadrant (such as adrenalin,
revolutionist, and whizzing) and in the bottom-left
quadrant (such as joylessness, disheartenment, and
disreputableness). Comparatively much fewer anx-
iety terms occur in the bottom right (high V and low
A) quadrants. Examples include seatbelt and post-
operative. In contrast, the majority of the calmness
terms (score < −0.5) occur in the high V quad-
rants. Examples, of low V terms associated with
calmness include pity and aloof. The V–D plots
show that anxiety terms tend to be concentrated in
the bottom-left quadrant, whereas calmness terms
are most commonly found in the top-right quadrant.
Anxiety terms associated with high D include terms
such as skyrocket, canny, gunfight, and tyrant; anxi-
ety terms associated with low D include persecuted
and gutlessness.
Categorical Emotions: Table 4 shows the corre-
lations of anxiety scores of terms in WorryWords
with the anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sad-
ness, surprise, and trust scores of terms in the
NRC Emotion Intensity Lexicon v1 (Mohammad,
2018b). Observe that anxiety seems to essentially
have no correlation with anticipation, joy, and sur-
prise (correlation magnitudes less than 0.2); and
low correlation with the negative emotions: anger,
disgust, fear, and sadness. Among these emotions,
anxiety has the highest correlation with fear.
Discussion: Overall, we see that while anxiety as-
sociations follow some expected trends such as
pertaining to low valence, the magnitudes of cor-
relations are moderate with valence and low with
arousal and dominance. Thus anxiety presents it-
self in many different ways and cannot be charac-
terized simply with VAD. The fact that anxiety has
the highest correlation with fear (among the four
negative categorical emotions) is in line with the
belief that fear is a key aspect of anxiety (Rosen
and Schulkin, 1998; Shin and Liberzon, 2010).
6.2
At what rate do children acquire words
associated with anxiety? How does this
change with the Age of Acquisition?
Feeling anxious is a normal part of childhood and
growing up (Beesdo et al., 2009). The Cleveland
Clinic describes how very young children (6-month
to 3-year olds) can have separation anxiety from
parents and caregivers; pre-schoolers often develop
phobias towards specific things such as insect, dark-
ness, thunder, heights, etc.; and school age brings
many sources of anxiety such as going to a new
school, exams, social interactions, and managing
school work.7 Over the course of development,
the way children express, experience, and commu-
nicate their emotions, including anxiety, changes
(Bailen et al., 2019; Thompson, 1991). Under-
standing these changes is instrumental in promot-
ing healthy socio-emotional functioning across all
stages of development. Thus, the associations of
emotions with different ages is a key aspect studied
by researchers in child development.
With WorryWords we can now look specifi-
cally at the relationship between anxiety-associated
words and age. Specifically, in our work, we ex-
amine the correlation between the age at which
words are acquired by children in their vocabulary

(the age they learn the meanings of words) and the
anxiety associated with those words.
We do so by examining the words with entries
in both WorryWords and Kuperman et al. (2012)
age of acquisition dataset (which includes the age
at which ∼30K English words are commonly ac-
quired by children). Figure 2 shows the percentage
of words in WorryWords that are acquired at var-
ious ages. Subsets of words corresponding to the
three anxiety classes are shown in shades of orange,
corresponding to the three calmness classes are
shown in shades of green, and the amount of words
neither associated with anxiousness nor calmness
are shown in grey.
Observe that the percentage of words acquired
increases steadily with age, peaking at 11, and then
decreasing rapidly after that. The percentage of
anxiety and calmness words also largely follows
the same pattern, but some notable additional ob-
servations can be made. At a very early age (1 to 4
years) the percentage of calmness words acquired is
higher than the percentage of anxiety words. How-
ever, from age 5 onwards, children learn more anx-
iety words than calmness words.
Figure 3 shows the percentage of words acquired
each year for each of the anxiety and calmness
classes; i.e., after disregarding the neither anxious
nor calm words, what percentage of words acquired
in a year correspond to each of the six other classes.
(For every x-axis value, the six percentages sum
up to 100%.) Observe that from age 3 onwards,
the percentage of anxiety words increases steadily
with age (for all three anxiety classes), whereas,
the percentage of calmness words decreases with
age (for all three calmness classes).
Figure 3: For all of the non-neutral WorryWords terms
acquired at age x: the percentage corresponding to each
of the non-neutral anxiety–calmness bins. (The six per-
centages for each age sum up to 100%.)
Discussion: The notable trends in the relative rates
of acquisition of anxiety and calmness terms with
age have implications in developmental psychology
and evolutionary linguistics (Price, 2013; Breggin,
2015). They may also be relevant in the under-
standing of and coping with childhood anxieties
(Wright et al., 2010; Legerstee et al., 2010). We
hope that WorryWords will spur further research in
these areas.

Capturing Anxiety Arcs in Text
Streams using WorryWords
A common use of emotion lexicons is to determine
emotion arcs and trends in how emotions change in
a stream of textual data. For example, determining
changes in the degree of anger towards a product
in social media over time (Breeze, 2020), tracking
happiness and well-being of different cities and
counties through geo-located posts on X (formerly
Twitter) in public health research (Frank et al.,
2013), generating emotion arcs of stories in dig-
ital humanities (Mohammad, 2011; Ohman et al.,
2024), etc. The lexicons may be used in combina-
tion with supervised systems and large language
models (where such resources are available), or
they may be used on their own where interpretabil-
ity, low-carbon foot print, and simpler systems are

valued — which is often the case in psychology and
public health research. Lexicon-only methods are
often markedly less accurate at determining emo-
tions of individual sentences. However, Teodor-
escu and Mohammad (2023) have shown that on
the task of generating emotion arcs (where emotion
scores of hundreds, if not thousands, of individual
sentences are averaged to determine points on the
emotion arc) lexicon-only methods are competitive
with more sophisticated neural and large language
models.8 In this section we explore:
1. How accurate are anxiety arcs generated using
WorryWords alone?
2. Given the close relationship between anxi-
ety and other emotion categories such as fear,
anger, and low valence, how good are lexicons
for other emotions at capturing anxiety arcs?
Together these results tell us about the usefulness
of WorryWords in the task of generating emotion
arcs, as well as how anxiety-associated and other-
emotion-associated words present themselves in
sentences that have been marked for anxiety.
7.1
Creating the Anxiety Arcs
First we quickly summarize how emotion arcs are
created. The user (anyone interested in tracking
anxiety for a text stream of interest) provides the:
• Text Stream: A series of instances (sentences,
posts, etc.) in order of interest (e.g., posts on
X that mention #climatechange ordered by
timestamps, sentences from a novel).
• Bins: A pre-chosen grouping (day, month,
year, k sentences, etc. — based on granularity
of interest)9. An additional parameter relevant
when the bin is specified in terms of number
of sentences (say, k) is the step size. For
example, a step size of s instances means that
after including sentences 1 to k in the first
bin, the next bin includes instances 1 + s to
1 + s + k, then 1 + 2s to 1 + 2s + k, and so
on. Commonly used step sizes are 1 (highly
overlapping bins – leading to smoother arcs)
and k (non-overlapping bins).
8Even though an individual lexicon entry only provides the
emotion association with the predominant sense (and does not
take context into account), by tracking the emotions associated
with hundreds of co-occurring words in a text stream we make
use of context. If for example, an anger-inducing event occurs,
then the corresponding bin is likely include many words that
will have an association with anger.
9For e.g., anxiety in tweets about climate change where
one wants to track changes month by month, each bin includes
the tweets posted in the corresponding month.
We generate the predicted arc for this text stream
by simply taking the average anxiety association
scores of words (taken from WorryWords) for each
bin. Terms not found in the lexicon are disregarded
when determining these scores. The gold arc can
be created by taking the averages of the manually
labeled anxiety scores (labels) of each of the posts
in the bins. The closer the predicted arc to the gold
arc, the more accurate it is.
However, there exists no cohesive text streams
dataset with annotations for anxiety. That said,
there exist datasets where independent sentences
are annotated for anxiety, such as the stress dataset
by Rastogi et al. (2022). Since this dataset is not as-
sociated with a particular event where there might
be ups and downs of emotions, a completely ran-
dom ordering of the data or using timestamps to
order the data into a text stream, produces of a
flat line anxiety arc. Thus, we created new text
streams by sampling posts from the Rastogi et al.
(2022) dataset (5,488 Reddit posts), with replace-
ment, such that the gold anxiety arc had portions
with various random amplitudes and slopes (spik-
iness).10 (Note that sampling is a way to create
a new ordering of the posts.) We continued sam-
pling until we created text streams that were 10,000
sentences long. We then repeated the procedure
1000 times to create 1000 different text streams
(and corresponding gold arcs). These text streams
can now be used to evaluate automatic methods of
determining anxiety arcs. The yellow line in Figure
4 (a) shows the beginning portion of one of the gold
anxiety arcs (the 1000th arc) for bin size of 50.
7.2
Results
The green line in Figure 4 (a) shows the beginning
portion of the predicted anxiety arc when using
the lexicon-only method, word associations from
WorryWords, and a rolling window with bin size
50.11 Observe that the green line traces the gold
line quite closely. There are also occasions where
it overshoots or fails to reach the gold arc. The
column on the right in the figure lists the average
Spearman correlation between the predicted and
10Sampling without replacement led to the same results, but
sampling with replacement allowed reuse of the limited la-
beled data to produce longer waves. The random arc sampling
algorithm is described in the Appendix.
11Note that bin size is a user specified parameter. Bin size
of 50 posts is relatively small and often only used when data
is sparse, e.g., tracking character arcs in novels. Results with
bigger bin sizes are often better (as more data is used to infer
change of emotion across bins) – as shown ahead.

Figure 4: Predicted (green) anxiety arcs when applying four different types of association scores to one of the test
data text streams: a. anxiety association from WorryWords, b. valence (from NRC VAD), c. arousal (from NRC
VAD), and dominance (from NRC VAD). The gold (yellow) arc pertaining to the same text stream is repeated in all
four figures for reference. Bin size used to create the arcs: 50 posts. On the right is the average correlation between
1000 pairs of gold and predicted arcs for each case.

of predicted and gold anxiety arcs for different bin sizes.
gold arcs for all 1000 text streams (for the full
length of the text streams: 10,000 posts) . We note
that the arc generated using the anxiety lexicon has
a high correlation with the gold arc (greater than
0.9) – sufficient for most applications.
Figure 4 (b), (c), and (d) show the same gold
anxiety arc but show predicted arcs using valence,
arousal, and dominance scores, respectively (taken
from the NRC VAD Lexicon). These figures act as
control arcs (for comparison with the WorryWords
arc). The column on the right shows the average
correlations for the 1000 pairs of gold and predicted
arcs. We see that the gold arc is highly negatively
correlated with valence (-0.85). Just in terms of
the magnitude of correlation, arousal is closer to
anxiety than dominance with anxiety.
Categorical Emotions: Figure 9 in the Appendix
shows similar gold and predicted arcs (and overall
average correlations) for the gold anxiety arc and
predicted arcs generated using lexicons for eight
other categorical emotions. The magnitudes of cor-
relation obtained using lexicons for these emotions
is lower than that obtained using WorryWords.
Window Size Effect: We repeated the experi-
ments described above with many window sizes
and found similar overall trends. However, using
larger window sizes generally led to higher corre-
lations. Table 5 shows these results. In addition to
Spearman rank correlation the table also shows an-
other metric of arc–arc closeness: root mean square
error (RMSE). The closer the two arcs, the smaller
the RMSE. Observe that there is a plateauing effect
in closeness after a window size of a few hundred
posts (around ρ = 0.955 and RMSE = 0.075).

Conclusion
We created WorryWords — a large lexicon of
word–anxiety association scores with the help of
responses to a simple questionnaire, by over 1000
respondents (mainly from the US, but also from
India, UK, and Canada). We showed that the re-
sponses led to highly reliable scores. We compared
how anxiety association scores correlate with the
scores for various other emotions. We determined
the rate at which anxiety words are acquired with
age; specifically, how from ages 1 to 4 children
learn more calmness words than anxiety words,
and that trend is reversed age 5 onwards. Finally,
we showed how WorryWords can be used to track
anxiety in large text streams. We make Worry-
Words freely available to enable a wide variety of
anxiety associated research.

Limitations
For limitations associated with the dataset, please
refer to the Ethics Statement (§10).
The lexicographic experiments in Section 6
make use of existing emotion and Age of Acquisi-
tion datasets. The labels for these datasets reflect
their annotators, who were mainly US and Euro-
pean English speakers. Thus further experiments
with datasets pertaining to other locations and de-
mographics are needed to determine how widely
applicable or universal some of these conclusions
are. The conclusions form our work should largely
be seen as applicable to the demographics of its
annotators (and not beyond).
The emotion arc experiments were done on
an existing stress-labeled dataset of Reddit posts.
However, the datasets does not correspond to a
natural textstream such as tweets about a new gov-
ernment policy or utterances of a character in a
novel. (No such dataset has human annotations
for anxiety.) However, by creating text streams
corresponding to a thousand different emotion arcs
from an existing Reddit dataset, we created a robust
anxiety arc gold dataset.
10
Ethics Statement
Emotions are complex and nuanced mental states.
Additionally, each individual expresses emotions,
including anxiety, differently through language,
which results in large amounts of variation. See
Mohammad (2023) for a discussion of good prac-
tises and ethical considerations when using emo-
tion lexicons. See Mohammad (2022) for a broader
discussion of ethical considerations relevant to au-
tomatic emotion recognition. We discuss below
notable ethical considerations when computation-
ally analyzing anxiety.
Importantly, WorryWords should not be used
as a standalone tool for detecting anxiety disor-
ders. We hope future research, led by clinicians
and medical practitioners, will assess the useful-
ness of WorryWords in mental health applications,
in combination with various other sources of infor-
mation.
The crowd-sourced task was approved by our
Institutional Research Ethics Board. Our annota-
tion process stored no information about annotator
identity and as such there is no privacy risk to them.
The individual words selected did not pose any
risks beyond occasionally reading text on the in-
ternet. The annotators were free to do as many
word annotations as they wished. The instructions
included a brief description of the purpose of the
task (Figure 5).
Any lexical dataset of emotion-association
norms entails several ethical considerations.
• Coverage: We sampled a large number of En-
glish words from many sources (which them-
selves sample from many sources). Yet, it
is possible that the words included do not
cover all domains, genres, and people of dif-
ferent locations, socio-economic strata, etc.
equally. It likely includes more of the vo-
cabulary common in the United States with a
socio-economic and educational backgrounds
that allow for technology access.
• Word Senses and Dominant Sense Priors:
Words when used in different senses and con-
texts may be associated with different degrees
of anxiety. The entries in WorryWords are
indicative of the anxiety associated with the
predominant senses of the words. This is usu-
ally not too problematic because most words
have a highly dominant main sense (which
occurs much more frequently than the other
senses). In specialized domains, some terms
might have a different dominant sense than
in general usage. Entries in the lexicon for
such terms should be appropriately updated or
removed.
• Not Immutable: The anxiety scores do not
indicate an inherent unchangeable attribute.
The associations can change with time (e.g.,
the increase in anxiety associated with cough-
ing during a world-wide pandemic), but the
dataset entries are largely fixed. They pertain
to the time they are created.
• Socio-Cultural Biases: The annotations for
anxiety capture various human biases. These
biases may be systematically different for dif-
ferent socio-cultural groups. Our data was
annotated by mostly US and Indian English
speakers, but even within the US and India
there are many diverse socio-cultural groups.
Notably, crowd annotators on Amazon Me-
chanical Turk do not reflect populations at
large. In the US for example, they tend to
skew towards male, white, and younger peo-
ple. However, compared to studies that in-
volve just a handful of annotators, crowd anno-
tations benefit from drawing on hundreds and

thousands of annotators (such as this work).
• Inappropriate Biases: Our biases impact how
we view the world, and some of the biases
of an individual may be inappropriate. For
example, one may have race or gender-related
biases that may percolate subtly into one’s no-
tions of anxiety associated with words. Our
dataset curation was careful to avoid words
from problematic sources. We also ask people
annotate terms based on what most English
speakers think (as opposed to what they them-
selves think). This helps to some extent, but
it can still capture historical anxiety associa-
tions with certain identity groups. This can
be useful for some socio-cultural studies; but
we also caution that anxiety association with
identity groups be carefully contextualized to
avoid false conclusions.
• Perceptions (not “right” or “correct” labels):
Our goal here was to identify common per-
ceptions of anxiety association. These are not
meant to be “correct” or “right” answers, but
rather what the majority of the annotators be-
lieve based on their intuitions of the English
language.
• It is more appropriate to make claims about
anxiety word usage rather than anxiety of the
speakers. For example, ‘the use of anxiety
words grew by 20%’ rather than ‘anxiety grew
by 20%’. A marked increase in anxiety words
is likely an indication that anxiety increased,
but there is no evidence that anxiety increased
by 20%.
• Comparative analyses can be much more
useful than stand-alone analyses.
Often,
anxiety word counts on their own are not
useful. For example, ‘the use of anxiety words
grew by 20% when compared to [data from
last year, data from a different person, etc.]’
is more useful than saying ‘on average, 5
anxiety words were used in every 100 words’.
• Inferences drawn from larger amounts of text
are often more reliable than those drawn from
small amounts of text. For example, ‘the use
of anxiety words grew by 20%’ is informative
when determined from hundreds, thousands,
tens of thousands, or more instances. Do not
draw inferences about a single sentence or
utterance from the anxiety associations of its
constituent words.
We recommend careful reflection of ethical consid-
erations relevant for the specific context of deploy-
ment when using WorryWords.

Sources of Terms Selected for Annotation
WorryWords includes terms selected from these
resources:
• All terms in the NRC Emotion Lexicon v1
(Mohammad and Turney, 2013, 2010): It in-
cludes about 14,000 common English words
with labels indicating whether they are asso-
ciated with any of the eight notable discrete
emotions identified by Plutchik (1980): anger,
anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, sur-
prise, and trust.
• All terms in the NRC VAD Lexicon v1 (Mo-
hammad, 2018a): It includes about 20,000
common English terms. Notably, it also in-
cludes terms common in X (formerly Twitter).
Posts on X include non-standard language
such as creatively spelled words (happee),
hashtags (#takingastand, #lonely) and con-
joined words (loveumom). These were taken
from the Twitter Emotion Corpus (Moham-
mad and Kiritchenko, 2015).
• Terms in the Prevalence dataset (Brysbaert
et al., 2019) that are marked as known to 70%
or more respondents: This dataset has preva-
lence scores (how widely a word is known by
English speakers), determined directly by ask-
ing people, for 62,000 lemmas. We included a
term if it was marked as known to at least 70%
of the people who provided responses for the
term. From this set we removed terms that are
common person names or city names.

Distribution of WorryWords
WorryWords is made freely available on the project
website as a compressed file. Terms of use will
require that users not re-distribute the file and not
post any form of the lexicon on the web. This is
to prevent the resource being included in the data
scrape fed to a large language model. See full list
of terms of use at the project home page. Table 6

Summary Instructions 
Consider anxiety to be a broad category that includes: 
jittery, antsy, insecure, nervous, unease, tense, worried, unnerving, 
nerve-racking, apprehensive, fretful, self-doubting, troubled, 
discontented, concerned, and keyed up 
Consider calmness to be a broad category that includes: 
calm, relaxed, comforted, serene, at ease, self-assured, carefree, 
composed, collected, untroubled, peaceful, contented, 
nonchalant, unconcerned, indifferent, uninterested, and uninvolved 
If you do not know the meaning of a word or are unsure, you can look it 
up in a dictionary (e.g., the Merriam Webster ) or on the internet. 
Quality Control 
Some questions have pre-determined correct answers. If you mark 
these questions incorrectly, we will give you immediate feedback in a 
pop-up box. An occasional misanswer is okay. However, if the rate of 
misanswering is high (e.g., >20%), then all of one's HITs may be rejected 
Select the options that ** most English speakers ** will agree with.

Random Arc Sampling Algorithm
In order to create a text stream (described in Section
6) such that the gold arc has various components
of random ups and downs of varying slopes, we
sample posts from a dataset of anxiety (1) and no-
anxiety (0) posts, with replacement, in short bursts
as follows. For each burst (sub-arc), we first ran-
domly determine a slope and number of posts to
make up the sub-arc. Then we sample posts from
the source datasets accordingly. For example, sam-
pling only anxiety posts will lead to a slope of 90
degrees, sampling only no-anxiety posts will lead
to a slope of -90 degrees, and sampling a mixture
will lead to a slope between -90 and +90 (depend-
ing on the proportion of anxiety and no-anxiety
posts). We continue sampling until the randomly
chosen length of the subarc is reached. Then the
whole procedure is repeated with new randomly
generated slopes and lengths of subarcs until the
text stream includes 10,000 posts.

Supplementary Figures and Tables
Figure 8 shows plots of the WorryWords terms
on valence–arousal and valence–dominance spaces
(described in Section 6.1). Table 7 shows the Spear-
man rank correlation between the word–emotion
association scores for various emotion pairs (dis-
cussed in Section 6.1).
Figure 9 shows predicted (green) anxiety arcs
when applying nine different emotion association
scores to one of the test data text streams (described
in Section 7).

Computational Resources and Carbon
Footprint
A nice advantage of using simple lexicon-based
approaches is the low carbon footprint and compu-
tational resources required. All of the experiments
described in the paper were conducted on a regular
personal laptop.

Figure 9: Predicted (green) anxiety arcs when applying nine different types of association scores to one of the
test data text streams: 1. associations with anxiety (from WorryWords); 2–9. associations with each of the eight
Plutchik emotions (from NRC Emotion Intensity Lexicon). The gold (yellow) arc pertaining to the same text stream
is repeated in all nine figures for reference. Bin size used to create the arcs: 50 posts. On the right is the average
correlation between 1000 pairs of gold and predicted arcs for each case.
