Abstract 
 
The current study investigated the presence of different anxiety profiles in schoolchildren in 
order to understand whether Mathematics and Test Anxiety are a manifestation of a general 
form of anxiety, or the expression of specific forms of anxiety. Moreover, we also examined 
the influence of personal protective factors. The results of a latent profile analysis, conducted 
on 664 children attending grades 3 to 6, clearly identified three different profiles 
distinguished on the basis of the level of general, test and mathematics anxiety. Protective 
factors, such as self-concept and resilience, were differently related to anxiety: The former 
was clearly lower when the risk profile was higher, whereas students were able to maintain a 
certain level of resilience up to an average risk of developing forms of anxiety. The 
implications of these findings may lead to the development of specific intervention programs 
aimed at reducing students’ anxiety and fostering self-concept and resilience.

Anxiety profiles and protective factors: A latent profile analysis in children 
 
 
 
Anxiety is an aversive motivational state that occurs in situations where the level of 
perceived threat to the individual is high (Eysenck & Calvo, 1992). Different forms of 
anxiety have been described in the literature but one of the most prominent is general anxiety 
(GA): this refers to an individual’s disposition to worry about many different events, 
behaviors or personal abilities of everyday life, together with a difficulty in controlling these 
worries (Eysenck & Calvo, 1992). While GA refers to a general condition of anxiety, other 
more specific forms of anxiety have also been described and have received a great deal of 
attention in the literature. Specifically, math anxiety, commonly defined as a feeling of 
tension, apprehension, or fear which may interfere with one's performance of mathematical 
tasks (Richardson & Suinn, 1972), and test anxiety (TA), a psychological, physical, or 
behavioral reaction to worry cognitions regarding potential failure in achievement/school 
assessment situations (Zeidner, 1998). 
In the extant literature, however, it is not clear whether MA and TA are a 
manifestation of a general form of anxiety, or the expression of specific forms of anxiety. As 
a consequence, mathematics anxiety (MA) and test anxiety (TA) have often been investigated 
separately. Their effects have been examined in relation either to academic performance (Hill 
et al., 2016; Putwain, Daly, Chamberlain, & Sadreddini, 2015; Roick & Ringeisen, 2017) or 
to other forms of anxiety, such as general anxiety (Carey, Devine, Hill, & Szűcs, 2017). To 
the best of our knowledge, different forms of anxiety and any factors protecting against it 
have not been investigated together, as part of the same study. Protective factors are 
conditions or attributes, such as strengths, resources, supports, that operate in different 
domains of functioning (i.e., individual, school, family) and help the individuals to foster

competence, promote successful development, and mitigate all the conditions associated with 
a higher likelihood of negative outcomes, or risk factors (Dekovic, 1999). 
In the present study, we considered personal protective factors (i.e., self-concept and 
resilience), and distinguished between their general and academic effects. To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the first contribution on the association of different forms of anxiety with 
personal protective factors in school-age children. 
 
 
The relationship between general-, mathematics-, or test anxiety with personal 
protective factors 
The results of previous meta-analyses suggest that GA is more closely related to TA 
than to MA (Hembree, 1988, 1990; Ma, 1999). Although the relationship between GA and 
MA is not particularly strong, GA seems to have a systematic effect on MA and on 
mathematics achievement. For example, Hill and collegues (2016) found that partialling out 
the effect of GA reduced the significant negative relationship between MA and mathematics 
achievement in primary- and middle-school students. Regarding the relationship between GA 
with either self-concept or resilience in college students, previous studies revealed an 
association between negative affect responses to aversive situations and lower levels of self- 
esteem or self-concept ( e.g., Moreland & Sweeney, 1984; Smith & Petty, 1995; see also 
Lowe, Papanastasiou, Deruyck, & Reynolds, 2005; Lowe, Peyton, & Reynolds, 2007). 
Notably, in graduate students, the correlation between GA and self-concept was moderate and 
negative. Benetti and Kambouropoulos (2006), using path analyses, examined the influence 
of resilience and GA on self-concept in undergraduate students and investigated the 
mediating role of positive and negative effects. Their findings indicated that positive and 
negative affects significantly mediated the influence of resilience and GA on self-concept, 
respectively with any significant direct effects between GA, resilience and self-concept.

ANXIETY PROFILES AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS 
 
 
Coming to MA, an extensive body of literature documents that not only cognitive 
factors, but also low self-confidence in math or negative attitudes to math teachers, are 
related to poor performance in math classes (Ashcraft, Kirk & Hopko, 1998; Ma, 1999; 
Maloney & Beilock, 2012; Mammarella, Caviola, Giofrè, & Borella, 2017; Mammarella, 
Hill, Devine, Caviola, & Szűcs, 2015). As for the role of personal protective factors, several 
studies have analyzed the relationship between academic self-concept and MA. In a cross- 
cultural study examining 15 years-olds from 41 countries, Lee (2009) found that MA and 
math self-concept are inversely related to one another. In a recent study, Justicia-Galiano, 
Martín-Puga, Linares, and Pelegrina (2017) investigated whether working memory and math 
self-concept mediate the relationship between MA and math performance among school-age 
children. Their results indicated that both working memory and math self-concept, as 
mediators, contributed to explaining the relationship between MA and mathematics 
achievement. Intriguingly, other researchers have suggested that MA is antecedent to self- 
concept and self-esteem (Ahmed, Minnaert, Kuyper & van der Werf, 2012). This would 
mean that MA can promote negative academic self-concepts regarding math abilities 
(Ashcraft & Kirk, 2001; Wu, Barth, Amin, Malcarne, & Menon, 2012). 
Tests can trigger another type of academic anxiety, called test anxiety. Classic 
measures of TA have used “worry” and “emotionality” to distinguish between its cognitive 
and affective-physiological aspects, respectively (Morris, Davis, & Hutchings, 1981). More 
recent measures have considered other features of TA too, such as specific autonomic bodily 
reactions of anxiety, social evaluation and cognitive interference (Benson, Moulin-Julian, 
Schwarzer, Seipp, & El-Zahhar, 1992; Lowe, Grumbein, & Raad, 2011; Wren & Benson, 
2004). Several studies have attested to the relationship between TA and protective factors like 
academic self-concept and self-esteem, which describe the individual’s self-perceived ability 
in academic situations, with a strong impact on a student’s TA (Goetz, Preckel, Zeidner, & 

6 
ANXIETY PROFILES AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS 
 
 
Schleyer, 2008; Hembree, 1988). Research has identified poor self-directed competence 
beliefs as a major cause of TA (Bong & Skaalvik, 2002; Putwain & Daniels, 2010). 
Bandalos, Yates, and Thorndike-Christ (1995) also found that academic self-concept was 
negatively related to TA, and mediated the link between prior experience and anxiety in 
undergraduate students. The relationship between resilience and TA has been examined too. 
According to Martin and Marsh (2006), resilient pupils can perform better under pressure, in 
anxiety-inducing testing situations, by maintaining a strong belief in their ability (which 
supports their effort and persistence), or by controlling worries likely to interfere with their 
performance. Putwain, Nicholson, Connors, and Woods (2013) examined whether TA 
mediated the relations between resilience and performance in a high-stake tests, after 
controlling for prior abilities in students attending grade 6. They found a significant indirect 
relationship between resilience and test performance, that was mediated by TA. A particular 
form of resilience, called academic buoyancy, also seems to be related to TA. Academic 
buoyancy is a relatively new construct emerging from the resilience literature, and defined as 
the student’s response to academic challenges and pressures (Martin & Marsh, 2006, 2008, 
2009). Academic buoyancy is associated with positive academic outcomes, including lower 
levels of TA and higher levels of persistence and confidence (Martin, Colmar, Davey, & 
Marsh, 2010; Putwain, Connors, Symes, & Douglas-Osborn, 2012). According to the self- 
referral model of TA devised by Zeidner and Matthews (2005), academic buoyancy could be 
seen as a factor protecting against maladaptive forms of coping and avoidance. For instance, 
buoyant students may have experienced failure in the past, or may expect to fail in the future, 
but this does not give rise to attributions likely to reduce their effort or motivation simply to 
protect  themselves.  Putwain  and  colleagues  (2012)  also  found  that  academic  buoyancy 
explained a significant portion of the variance in all components of TA (ranging from R2=.13 
to R2=.23), and was inversely related thereto.

The present Study 
 
Earlier research tended to study the effects of GA, TA, or MA in isolation, with scarce 
consideration for the effects of personal protective factors such as self-concept and resilience. 
Carey and colleagues (2017) recently assessed different forms of anxiety by conducting a 
latent profile analysis on students in grade 4, or in grades 7 and 8. They identified four 
profiles in grade 4, ranging from low to high anxiety. This four-group solution also emerged 
on students in grades 7 and 8, but the profiles appeared more specific in this case, and were 
described as: low anxiety; general anxiety; academic anxiety (i.e., MA and TA); and high 
anxiety. Studying such latent profiles, it is interesting to see how distinct but related forms of 
anxiety appear within a population. Unlike simple correlations, latent profiles help us to 
identify heterogeneous subgroups that express certain anxiety patterns. For these reasons, in 
the present study we conducted a latent profiles analysis on a large group of 3rd- to 6th-grade 
 
primary-school children, considering their scores on GA, TA and MA. Our first aim was to 
test whether specific latent profiles of anxiety emerged between 3rd - and 6th –graders in order 
to better understand whether MA and TA emerged as unique forms of a more general 
apprehension (GA) or specific expressions of different form of anxiety, at least for these 
particular age groups. We expected to find different profiles of anxiety derived by the 
combination of GA, TA and MA, in agreement with the results of meta-analytical studies 
which showed moderate correlations among these variables (Hembree, 1988, 1990; Ma, 
1999). We focused on a wide age range to shed more light on whether it is already possible to 
distinguish between different forms of anxiety (mainly general and academic) even in 
younger children. However, given that previous studies shown that TA and MA peak around 
grades 9 to 10, and do not change thereafter (Ashcraft & Moore, 2009; Hembree, 1990), we 
did not expect strong age-differences in our sample. 

8 
ANXIETY PROFILES AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS 
 
 
Another aim of our study was to test the role of personal protective factors such as 
self-concept and resilience in relation to latent profiles of different forms of anxiety. As 
mentioned previously, academic self-concept and resilience, or academic buoyancy, both 
seem to be inversely related to TA. While previous studies mainly investigated the 
relationship between academic self-concept or academic buoyancy and anxiety (and TA in 
particular), here we distinguished between general and academic personal protective factors. 
This is because we assumed that, just as it seems important to distinguish between general 
and academic forms of anxiety, so too could a distinction between general and academic 
personal protective factors help to clarify their potential relationship between different latent 
profiles of anxiety. We, thus, expected that general and academic personal protective factors 
would have a different influence on latent profiles of anxiety, in agreement with previous 
studies showing a negative relation between TA and academic buoyancy (Martin et al., 
2010). 
 
 
Method 
 
Participants 
 
The study originally involved 666 children. However, some of the data from two 
children were missing and we decided to exclude these data from the analyses. Our final 
sample included 664 schoolchildren (Mage = 9.20 years, SD = 1.13 years), 52.6% males and 
47.4% females, attending primary school, in grades 3 to 6 (with 184, 206, 166, and 108 
children in grades, 3, 4, 5 and 6, respectively). Seven different schools were involved and 
recruited through well-established contacts of the first Author. The children came from 
middle-class families1, and were attending schools in urban areas of north-east Italy: 5% of 
the sample was composed of African ethnicity and 3% of other ethnicities. The study was 
approved by the Ethics Committee on Psychology Research at the University of Padova,

Materials 
General anxiety 
The Revised Children’s Manifest Anxiety Scale: Second Edition (RCMAS-2; 
Reynolds & Richmond, 2012) is a self-report questionnaire for detecting general anxiety in 
children from 6 to 19 years old. It comprises 49 items with a yes/no response format. The 
questionnaire consists of two scales, the Total Anxiety scale and the Defensiveness scale, 
and three anxiety subscales, Social Anxiety, Physiological Anxiety, and Worry.. Items 
assessed, for example, whether the child often presents stomach ache, whether s/he is worried 
that his/her classmates could make fun of him/her and whether the child feels nervous when 
things don’t go as s/he wants. The total anxiety score (Cronbach α = .89) was used for the 
present study. As reported in the manual (see Reynolds & Richmond, 2012), the RCMAS-2 
presents good convergent validity (r =.61) and test-retest reliability (r= .71) for the total 
anxiety score. 
Academic anxiety 
 
Math-anxiety. The Abbreviated Math Anxiety Scale (AMAS; Hopko, Mahadevan, 
Bare, & Hunt, 2003) is a self-report tool developed to assess MA. The Italian version of the 
AMAS for children was used in the present study (Caviola, Primi, Chiesi, & Mammarella, 
2017). Like the original English version, the questionnaire contains 9 items that describe 
different situations involving math. Children were asked to assess each item in terms of how 
anxious they would be, scoring them on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 “strongly agree” to 5 
“strongly disagree”, the higher the number the greater their mathematical anxiety. A good 
internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = .77) was observed. Finally, strong convergent validity 

10 
ANXIETY PROFILES AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS 
 
 
(r= .85) and excellent 2-weeks rest-retest reliability (r= .85) were found in adults (see Hopko 
et al., 2003). 
Test-anxiety. The Test Anxiety Questionnaire for Children (TAQ-C; Donolato, Marci, 
Altoè, & Mammarella, submitted) a new self-report for assessing TA in children was used. 
The questionnaire was translated and readapted from the Children’s Test Anxiety Scale 
(CTAS; Wren & Benson, 2004) from which three subscales were used: thoughts (e.g., “I 
think I’m going to get a bad grade”); off-Task Behaviors (e.g., “I play with my pencil”); and 
autonomic reactions (e.g., “My heart beats fast”). The social derogation subscale from the 
FRIEDBEN Test Anxiety Scale for Adolescents (FTA; Friedman & Bendas-Jacob, 1997) was 
considered too (e.g., “I am worried that all my friends will get high scores in the test and only 
I will get low ones”). The self-report consisted of 37 items. Participants gave their answers on 
a 4-point Likert scale (from “almost never” to “almost always”). In the current sample, 
Cronbach’s α was .84. Moreover, good convergent validity (r ranging from.71 to .77) and 
test-retest validity (r=.74) for the total score were found (Donolato et al., submitted). 
General protective factors 
 
Self-Concept - Competence scale (SC-Competence scale; Italian translation, Bracken, 
2003). The Competence subscale is part of the Multidimensional Self-Concept Scale (MSC) 
that is developed for children between 9 and 19 years old. Specifically, the Competence 
subscale is composed by 25 items used to measure general protective factors (e.g., “I 
trust in myself”). Participants responded on a 4-point Likert scale from “absolutely true” 
to “absolutely false”. The total score was calculated as recommended in the manual 
(Bracken, 2003), so higher scores corresponded to a greater degree of competence self- 
concept (Cronbach’s α = .79). As reported in the manual (see Bracken, 2003), the subscale is 
characterized by good 4-weeks test-retest reliability (r= .76) as well as good convergent 
validity for the total MSC score (r=.73).

ANXIETY PROFILES AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS 
 
 
The Ego-Resiliency scale (ER; Block & Kremen, 1996) is brief inventory used to 
detect a set of traits relating to general resourcefulness, strength of character, and flexibility 
of functioning in response to different environmental demands, which reflects an individual’s 
capacity for appropriate self-regulation. The scale has been used both with adults and 
children (see Caprara, Steca & De Leo, 2003). Participants used a 4-point scale from 1 (“does 
not apply at all”) to 4 (“applies very strongly”) to score 14 items, including “I quickly get 
over and recover from being startled”, and “I enjoy dealing with new and unusual situations”. 
Good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = .75) and 2-years test-retest reliability (r= .39) 
scores were observed in children and adolescents (see Caprara, Steca & De Leo, 2003). 
Academic protective factors 
 
Self-Concept – Academic scale (SC-Academic scale; Italian translation, Bracken, 
2003). The academic subscale is part of the Multidimensional Self-Concept Scale (MSC) that 
is devised for children between 9 and 19 years old. The subscale was used to assess academic 
protective factors (e.g., “I am good in mathematics”) and contains 25 items. Participants gave 
their answers on a 4-point Likert scale, from (“absolutely false”) to (“absolutely true”). The 
total score was calculated as explained in (Bracken, 2003), so higher scores corresponded to 
higher levels of academic self-concept (Cronbach’s α = .87). The academic subscale showed 
good test-retest reliability (r= .81) as well as good convergent validity regarding the total 
MSC score (r=.73), as reported by the authors (see Bracken, 2003). 
Academic Buoyancy Scale (ABS; Martin & Marsh, 2008a, 2008b) is a brief inventory 
for assessing the ability to face and deal successfully with academic difficulties and 
challenges typical of ordinary school life (e.g., poor grades, competing deadlines, exam 
pressure, difficult schoolwork). The questionnaire is composed of 4 items (e.g. “I’m good at 
dealing with setbacks at school”) rated from 1 (“strongly disagree”) to 7 (“strongly agree”), 
which have been translated for the present study in Italian. The scale showed good internal 

12 
ANXIETY PROFILES AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS 
 
 
consistency (Cronbach’s α was .82) and test-retest reliability (r =.67) as reported by the 
authors (see Martin & Marsh, 2008a). 
 
 
Procedure 
 
The children were tested in a collective session in their classroom lasting 
approximately 60 minutes, during which the self-report questionnaires were administered in a 
fixed pseudorandomized order (SC-Competence scale, SC-Academic scale, RCMAS-2, 
AMAS, ER, TA, ABS). Questionnaires were presented one at the time and students had a 
short break after the completion of each questionnaire. Questionnaires were administrated by 
the second Author, a second-year PhD student in psychology. Children were not compensated 
for their participation, which is a standard practice in Italy. 
 
 
Statistical analyses 
 
R was used in all the analyses (R Core Team, 2017). Cluster analyses were run using 
the mclust package in R environment (Fraley, Raftery, Murphy, & Scrucca, 2012). For all the 
cluster analyses the default settings of mclust were used, more information about model 
comparisons, estimating procedures and starting values are provided in the technical 
publication (Scrucca, Fop, Murphy, & Raftery, 2016). 
Graphs were obtained using the ggplot2 package in R environment (Wickham, 2009). 
Bootstraps were also performed using ggplot2, which is calculating 95% CI, based on the 
means, and using 1,000 boots. In all the analyses, both the statistical significance and the 
magnitude of the difference in terms of the effect size were presented.

Table 1 shows the correlations between all the measures and the children’s age in 
months, together with the descriptive statistics. Interestingly, negative moderate correlations 
were found between the two SC scores (i.e., Academic and Competence subscales) and all 
anxiety measures (i.e., GA, TA and MA). Small negative correlations between ER scores and 
both GA and MA were observed. Finally, small negative correlations between the ABS scale 
and all anxiety measures (i.e., GA, TA and MA scales) were found.

We used a model-based clustering analysis approach, modelling clusters as a finite 
mixture of Gaussian distribution fitted via the EM algorithm (Fraley & Raftery, 2002). This 
method enabled us to assess different clustering solutions in terms of the model parameters. 
Several clustering models were considered, in terms of their evidence measured against the 
BIC index, and the number of underlying components (from 1 to 4). The model with 3 risk 
profiles proved to be superior (i.e., it had a higher BIC), and this solution was retained 
for subsequent analyses (see Table 2).

Model-based clustering of the GA, MA, and TA scores yielded three profiles (Figure 
1). Profile 1 (N = 79, 11.72%) was labeled “low-risk” (because the anxiety scores were quite 
low overall); Profile 2 (N = 454, 66.22%) was labeled “average-risk” and refers to children 
with average levels of anxiety; finally, Profile 3 (N = 131, 22.06%) was labeled “high-risk” 
(because the levels of anxiety were high, particularly for GA and TA). Performances of GA, 
MA, and TA in these three profiles were not homogenous (Figure 1).

A mixed ANOVA was performed, having anxiety as the dependent variable, with 3 
risk profile [low, average and high] × 3 form of anxiety [GA, MA and TA] design was 
performed. The main effect of risk profile, F(2, 661) = 391.77, p < .001, η2
g = .351, the main 
 
effect of form of anxiety, F(2, 1322) = 113.18, p < .001, η2 = .085, and the interaction effect, 
 
F(4, 1322) = 33.93, p < .001, η2
g = .0.053, were statistically significant2. All the post-hoc 
tests, with Bonferroni’s corrections, were statistically significant (ps < .05) except for the 
difference between MA and GA or TA in the low-risk group (p > .05). The presence of a 
statistically significant interaction demonstrated that the profiles in the three groups were not 
flat. To further elucidate this finding we calculated the standardized difference between the 
three profiles across the three forms of anxiety (GA, MA, and TA). The results revealed 
extremely large effect sizes (Cohen’s d > 1.13) in all cases except for the difference in MA 
between the average- and high-risk groups, which was small in terms of effect size (Cohen’s 
d = .46), although statistically significant. Based on these findings, we surmise that the high- 
risk profile was characterized by higher levels of GA and TA, and lower levels of MA, while 
the average-risk profile featured average levels of GA and MA, and lower levels of TA. 
 
 
Differences between profiles on personal protective factors 
 
We ran a series of MANOVAs using school grade (grades 3 to 6) and risk profile 
(low, average and high risk) as fixed factors. In the first MANOVA, general protective 
factors (Self-Concept - Competence scale and Ego-Resiliency scale) were used as dependent 
variables. There was a statistically significant effect of the risk profile, F(4, 1302) = 29.26, p 
< .001; Wilk’s Λ = 0.842, η2
p = .082, but not of school grade, F(6, 1302) = 0.891, p = .501,

In the second MANOVA, academic protective factors (Self-Concept – Academic 
scale and Academic Buoyancy Scale) were used as dependent variables. There was a 
statistically significant effect of the risk profile, F(4, 1302) = 22.50, p < .001; Wilk’s Λ = 
0.875, η2
p = .082. The effect of school grade was statistically significant, F(6, 1302) = 2.89, p

profile, F(12, 1302) = 0.71, p = .744, Wilk’s Λ = 0.987, η2
p  = .006, was not. Post-hoc 
ANOVAs  confirmed  a  significant  effect  of the risk profile on  both  the Self-Concept – 
Academic scale, F(2, 652) = 44.02, p < .001, η2 = .119, and the Academic Buoyancy Scale, 
 
F(2, 652) = 9.33, p < .001, η2 = .028 (Figure 2). The effect of school grade was statistically 
 
significant for the Self-Concept – Academic scale, F(2, 652) = 3.18, p < .024, η2 = .014, but 
 
not for the Academic Buoyancy Scale, F(2, 652) = 1.79, p = .147, η2
p = .008 (Figure 3). 
A series of post-hoc analyses (using Bonferroni’s correction) was also performed on 
the effects found statistically significant. In terms of the effect of risk profile, the three 
profiles differed from each other on the Self-Concept Competence (p < .05) and Academic 
scales (p < .05). The low- and average-risk profiles were statistically different on the Ego- 
Resiliency scale (p < .05), while the low- and high-risk profiles differed statistically on the 
Academic Buoyancy Scale (p < .05). As for the effect of school grade, children in grades 3 
and 6 were statistically different on the Self-Concept – Academic scale (p < .05).

Discussion 
 
The main aim of this study was to identify any presence of subgroups expressing 
particular anxiety patterns in a sample of school-age children, based on measures of GA, TA, 
and MA, using a latent profile analysis. We also tested the role of personal factors protecting 
against anxiety, distinguishing between general and academic self-concept and resilience. 
Concerning our first aim, we found a three-profile solution: a small proportion of 
children (around 12%) in our sample expressed a low risk, meaning that they showed very 
low scores in various forms of anxiety; a large proportion (around 66%) showed an average 
risk, exhibiting average scores of different kinds of anxiety; and the remaining 22% revealed 
a high-risk profile of experiencing different form of anxiety. The profiles in these three 
groups were not flat, however: no differences emerged in the levels of GA, TA, and MA in 
the low-risk group, in which all children obtained low scores of anxiety on all measures; the 
average-risk profile was characterized by higher levels of GA and MA, and lower levels of 
TA, but in all cases the scores ranged around the average; and the high-risk profile featured 
higher levels of GA and TA, but lower levels of MA, although all scores ranged in high 
levels of anxiety. 
Our latent profile analysis revealed different patterns of anxiety, albeit without any 
clear distinction between general and academic anxiety (which only becomes apparent in 
older students; on this point, see also Campbell & Rapee, 1996). According to Carey and 
colleagues (2017), MA can develop through two main mechanisms: a predisposition  to 
anxiety in general, or a repeatedly poor performance in mathematics. Our data seem to 
support the hypothesis that MA in younger children could be driven primarily by a general 
tendency to be anxious, since our average-risk profile was characterized by higher levels of 
GA and MA than of TA. Our findings do not exactly replicate those of Carey and colleagues 
(2017), however, partly because they tested students in grades 4 or 7-8, while our children 

17 
ANXIETY PROFILES AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS 
 
 
were in grades 3 to 6. In fact, the effect of age was not statically significant in our sample, so 
we found neither a simple distinction between different (i.e., low, average, high) degrees of 
risk to develop anxiety, nor any clear difference between general and academic forms of 
anxiety. In particular, testing children along a continuum, from grades 3 to 6, enabled us to 
identify an intermediate stage of anxiety development, at which point our high-risk profile 
coincided with more GA and TA than MA, while our average-risk profile showed more GA 
and MA than TA. Judging from our data, the hypothesis advanced by Carey and colleagues 
(2017) for the development of MA may therefore extend to TA as well. In other words, GA 
seems to act as a risk factor for the onset of other, more or less severe forms of anxiety (MA 
and TA). 
To better analyze developmental changes, further studies should try to replicate our 
findings in older students too. In particular, longitudinal research could help to  clarify 
whether the forms of anxiety seen in younger children are precursors of those identified in 
older students. The development of different forms of anxiety has so far been underexplored 
in the field of psychological research, and more information on this topic would help us to 
develop new, effective interventions, adapting their content to a given child’s developmental 
age and specific anxiety profile. 
The second goal of our study was to test the effects of personal general and academic 
factors protecting against anxiety. We found that distinguishing between general and 
academic protective factors did not produce different results by risk profile among children: 
the effect of self-confidence, be it general or academic, differentiated between the three 
profiles more clearly than the effect of resilience or academic buoyancy. In particular, 
children with a low-risk profile reported feeling more competent and had a stronger academic 
self-concept than children with average- or high-risk profiles. As for age differences, the 
correlations between age and personal protective factors were small. An intriguing effect 

18 
ANXIETY PROFILES AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS 
 
 
emerged on the Self-Concept – Academic scale, however, which was significantly higher for 
3rd-graders than for 6th-graders. The existing literature offers ample evidence of high levels of 
academic self-concept predicting low levels of TA (Bong & Skaalvik, 2002; Putwain & 
Daniels, 2010), and shown that MA promotes negative academic self-concepts regarding 
math abilities (Ashcraft & Kirk, 2001; Wu et al., 2012). Bandalos and colleagues (1995) also 
found that academic self-concept mediated the relation between prior experience and anxiety. 
Our study is the first to have jointly considered the relationship between different forms of 
anxiety and both academic and general self-concept. Self-competence was clearly inversely 
proportional to the level of anxiety: the higher the risk of becoming anxious, the lower the 
self-concept (on both the competence and the academic scales). Academic self-concept also 
tended to decline as the children grew older age, giving the impression that an older age (and 
possibly more negative academic experiences), is associated to a higher risk of anxiety, and 
to a worsening specific academic self-concept. 
As for the effect of resilience, we found that school children with a low anxiety risk 
profile scored higher than those at higher risk on both measures of resilience and academic 
buoyancy. The children at average risk of anxiety did not differ from those with a high-risk 
profile (or from the low-risk group when it came to academic buoyancy). Consistently with 
the definition of this construct, school children are therefore able to maintain a certain level 
of resilience at least up until they develop an average risk of becoming anxious. In fact, 
resilience only decreased in our high-risk group (with higher levels of both GA and TA). 
Thus, resilience and academic buoyancy are both personal factors crucial in  protecting 
against anxiety. Resilient students can maintain or regain prior levels of functioning, unlike 
those students who respond badly to adversity, and consequently risk developing higher 
levels of anxiety.

Although it contains some very interesting findings this study also has some 
limitations that should be addressed in future publications. First, our agreement with the 
schools did not include testing neither of first and second graders nor of students older than 
grade 8, hence further studies should also consider younger children in order to better 
understand the development of different forms of anxiety. Moreover, future studies should 
evaluate the role of general and academic personal protective factors in older children. This 
would be very important for understanding the complex interlink between these variables 
during the development. Second, our instruments included several self-reported measures, 
which can be somewhat affected by common-method bias (Williams & Brown, 1994), and 
were not administered in a counterbalanced order, similarly as already done in previous 
studies (e.g., Giofrè, Borella & Mammarella, 2017; Justicia-Galiano, et al., 2017; Hill et al., 
2016). Further research should replicate our outcomes also controlling for these small 
methodological issues. 
It is worth noting that our findings also have important clinical and educational 
implications: for a start, a better understanding of how different forms of anxiety develop is 
crucial to design specific intervention programs aimed at reducing students’ anxiety; as well 
as, fostering resilience can prevent academic anxiety. Our findings can be used to underpin 
the preparation and testing of interventions (Rose, Miller, & Martinez, 2009). In particular, 
interventions could be focused in promoting academic self-concept and resilience offering 
continuous feedback, suitable tasks based on children’s different competence levels, and 
promoting collaborative learning (Hagenauer & Hascher 2014). In addition, school-based 
interventions, based on cognitive and behavioral emotion regulation strategies for specific 
forms of anxiety, could reduce the onset of anxiety symptoms (Weems et al. 2015) and at the 
same time foster protective factors: students with high levels of self-concept and resilience 

20 
ANXIETY PROFILES AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS 
 
 
are able to take on challenging tasks, persist when faced with difficulties, and believe in their 
ability to do well (Niemiec & Ryan, 2009). 
To conclude, our study suggest that forms of anxiety start to differentiate between 3rd 
and 6th grade. Although no clear distinction between general and academic anxiety emerged 
in this age bracket, GA seemed to act as a risk factor for the onset of more specific forms of 
anxiety. Concerning the role of personal protective factors, different effects emerged for self- 
concept and resilience (both general and academic): self-concept was lower the higher the 
anxiety risk profile (from low to average and high); and academic self-concept also decreased 
with age, while resilience only decreased in association with the high anxiety risk profile.

1 A demographic questionnaire was administered in order to estimate the socio-economic 
condition of the family. In particular, children were required to report whether their parents 
were employed or not and to briefly describe the job of both parents. 
2 The analysis was also repeated including school grades. The effect of grade, the two-way 
interactions between grade and risk profile, and between grade and anxiety, and the three- 
way interaction between grade, risk profile and anxiety were small and not statistically 
significant (ps > .051, η2
g < .004).
