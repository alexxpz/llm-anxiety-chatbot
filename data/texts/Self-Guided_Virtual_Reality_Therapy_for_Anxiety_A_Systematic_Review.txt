Abstract 
Background. Virtual reality (VR) technology can be used to treat anxiety symptoms and disorders. 
However, most VR interventions for anxiety have been therapist guided rather than self-guided.  
Objective. This systematic review aimed to examine the effectiveness and user experience (i.e., 
usability, acceptability, safety, and attrition rates) of self-guided VR therapy interventions in people 
with any anxiety condition as well as provide future research directions.  
Method. Peer-reviewed journal articles reporting on self-guided VR interventions for anxiety were 
sought from the Cochrane Library, IEEE Explore Digital Library, PsycINFO, PubMED, Scopus, and 
Web of Science databases. Study data from the eligible articles were extracted, tabulated, and 
addressed with a narrative synthesis.  
Results. A total of 21 articles met the inclusion criteria. The findings revealed that self-guided VR 
interventions for anxiety can provide an effective treatment of social anxiety disorder, public speaking 
anxiety, and specific phobias. User experiences outcomes of safety, usability, and acceptability were 
generally positive and the average attrition rate was low. However, there was a lack of standardised 
assessments to measure user experiences.  
Conclusion. Self-guided VR for anxiety can provide an engaging approach for effectively and safely 
treating common anxiety conditions. Nevertheless, more experimental studies are required to examine 
their use in underrepresented anxiety populations, their long-term treatment effects beyond 12 
months, and compare their effectiveness against other self-help interventions for anxiety (e.g., internet 
interventions and bibliotherapy).

1 Introduction 
Anxiety is an emotional response to perceived threats of future danger (American Psychiatric 
Association [APA], 2022). Signs and symptoms of anxiety include worries about danger (e.g., being 
hurt, losing control, or dying), tense muscles, physical trembling, rapid breathing, sweating, nausea, 
difficulty concentrating, sleep disturbance, and escape and avoidance behaviours (APA, 2022). If a 
person’s anxiety is excessive or prolonged, then they may be classified with an anxiety disorder 
(APA, 2022). These are separation anxiety disorder, selective mutism, specific phobia, social anxiety 
disorder, panic disorder, panic attack specifier, agoraphobia, generalised anxiety disorder, 
substance/medication induced anxiety disorder, anxiety disorder due to another medical condition, 
other specified anxiety disorder, and unspecified anxiety disorder (APA, 2022). The various anxiety 
disorders are distinct based on certain aspects, such as the types of objects or situations that are feared, 
the associated thoughts and behaviours, and the typical age at onset (APA, 2022). Treatment is 
essential as anxiety can impair daily functioning, worsen quality of life, and increase suicide risk 
(Bandelow et al., 2017, Kanwar et al., 2013; Wilmer et al., 2021).   
Virtual reality (VR) interventions can effectively treat anxiety symptoms and disorders 
(Andersen et al., 2023; Baghaei et al., 2021; Horigome et al., 2020; Schröder et al., 2023). VR 
involves using computerised devices, such as a head-mounted display (HMD) or Cave Automatic 
Virtual Environment (CAVE), to deliver immersive virtual worlds (Menzies et al., 2016; Pellas et al., 
2020). These worlds are often used for virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET), which involves 
people digitally confronting and desensitising themselves to anxiety-inducing stimuli and scenarios 
(e.g., spider encounters, medical operations, or public speaking; Carl et al., 2019; Emmelkamp & 
Meyerbröker, 2021). VR therapy for anxiety may also include psychoeducation (Pallavicini et al., 
2022), relaxation (Veling et al., 2021), cognitive and behavioural skill development (Emmelkamp & 
Meyerbröker, 2021), and cognitive distraction from distressing experiences (Wang et al., 2022). For 
instance, VR can reduce anxiety levels by immersing clients into relaxing virtual nature scenes 
involving beaches, meadows, mountains, and the sea (Riches et al., 2024). VR interventions for 

anxiety can either be standalone or used in conjunction with other therapies (e.g., cognitive therapy, 
medication) to complement professional practice (Andersen et al., 2023; Schröder et al., 2023). 
VR interventions for anxiety often have therapist guidance (Donker et al., 2019; Shahid et al., 
2024). This is where the therapists play an active role in guiding and facilitating the virtual reality 
experience for the client (McMahon & Boeldt, 2021). The therapist's involvement ensures proper 
implementation of the intervention, adherence to the treatment protocol, and monitoring of the client's 
progress and reactions during the session (Jingili et al., 2023). Therapists can exert control over the 
virtual environment, manipulating stimuli and adjusting the level of exposure to suit the client's needs 
(Jingili et al., 2023; Rowland et al., 2022). Their expertise in psychotherapy techniques allows them to 
provide real-time support, guidance, and feedback to help clients navigate challenging situations and 
develop coping strategies (McMahon & Boeldt, 2021). This approach also allows therapists to build a 
strong therapeutic alliance with clients, fostering trust, collaboration, and rapport (Horigome et al., 
2020). However, there are limitations with therapist support. Therapist guided VR sessions require the 
physical presence of a trained professional, which can be logistically challenging for people in 
geographically remote areas or who have limited access to mental health services (Jingili et al., 2023). 
The involvement of a therapist also increases the overall cost of treatment because it requires 
dedicated time and expertise. This cost factor poses a barrier to widespread adoption and affordability 
of VR therapy interventions (Caponnetto et al., 2021). Moreover, the reliance on therapist guidance 
may create a dependency on the therapist's presence (Clemens, 2010), which could potentially make it 
challenging for individuals to generalise skills learned in the virtual environment to real-world 
situations independently. The fidelity of delivery and obtained VR therapy outcomes for clients may 
also vary depending on the skills and experience of the therapist (McMahon & Boeldt, 2021). Given 
these issues, a potential workaround is for VR therapy to be self-guided. 
Self-guided VR therapy for anxiety involves people engaging in the therapeutic experience 
without the direct presence and guidance of a therapist (Donker et al., 2018; Jingili et al., 2023). In 
this approach, individuals have control over their VR sessions, such as the selection of environments 
and the level of exposure to feared stimuli (Premkumar et al., 2021). Self-guided VR therapy can 

potentially empower individuals to take an active role in their own treatment and provide them with 
greater autonomy, flexibility, and convenience (Jingili et al., 2023). It allows individuals to engage in 
therapy at their own pace and in the comfort of their own space, reducing barriers such as travel time 
and scheduling constraints (Jingili et al., 2023). Self-guided computerised treatment of anxiety can 
increase access to mental health interventions, particularly for individuals in remote areas or those 
who encounter limitations in seeking face-to-face therapy (e.g., long waitlists; Haug et al., 2012; 
Jingili et al., 2023; Porter et al., 2023). It also promotes self-efficacy and empowers individuals to 
develop and practice coping skills independently (Jingili et al., 2023).  
Despite the potential benefits of self-guided VR therapy for anxiety, there are user experience 
issues that need consideration. A common health and safety risk with VR is simulator sickness, which 
involves negative symptoms (e.g., eyestrain, headache, nausea, vertigo, and dizziness) wrought by a 
visual and sensorimotor mismatch between the user’s body movements and the virtual environment 
(Balk et al., 2013; Cullen et al., 2021). It is possible that self-guided VR treatment may also aggravate 
pre-existing conditions (e.g., headaches, epileptic seizures), lead to collisions with physical objects, 
carry a hygiene risk of infection due to hardware being made of fomite material, and heighten 
psychological distress during VRET that could be poorly managed without therapist support (Cullen 
et al., 2021; Goldsworthy et al., 2024; Kelson et al., 2021; Wang & Chan, 2024). It is also important 
to consider if clients find the self-guided VR technology to be usable (i.e., easy to learn, efficient in 
performing tasks, not prone to errors, memorable, and satisfying to use; Nielsen, 2012) and acceptable 
(i.e., they are agreeable towards using the system; Cullen et al., 2021).  Negative user experiences 
regarding safety, usability, and acceptability may lead to higher attrition and poorer therapy outcomes 
(Balk et al., 2013; Benbow & Anderson, 2019; Cullen et al., 2021).  
The existing reviews on virtual reality (VR) therapy for anxiety highlight the growing interest 
in both therapist-guided and self-guided interventions. For instance, a systematic review by Pelucio et 
al. (2024) compares therapist-guided and self-guided cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), 
emphasizing the potential of self-guided approaches but falling short of focusing exclusively on VR-
based methods. Similarly, reviews such as those by Dhunnoo et al. (2024) and Wiebe et al. (2022) 

investigate extended reality therapies and VR for mental health diagnostics and treatment, 
respectively, but often prioritize therapist-guided interventions and lack a detailed examination of 
self-guided VR applications. Wu et al. (2021) and Andersen et al. (2023) review VR-assisted CBT 
and broader VR interventions for anxiety disorders, focusing on therapeutic effectiveness but 
neglecting a thorough analysis of self-guided applications and user experience. Shahid et al. (2024) 
and Baghaei et al. (2021) focus on user experience and effectiveness in VR therapies for social 
anxiety and mental health disorders but lack specificity regarding standalone self-guided VR 
interventions. Furthermore, Oing and Prescott (2018) review the implementations of VR for anxiety-
related disorders but provide limited insights into the standalone self-guided approach. To our 
knowledge, there is currently no review appraising the effectiveness of self-guided VR interventions 
for anxiety treatment and concomitant user experience outcomes. To address this gap and help inform 
clinicians, researchers, and clients interested in exploring this mental health domain, this review 
examines existing literature to answer the following research questions: 
RQ 1. Is self-guided VR therapy an effective treatment modality for anxiety? 
RQ 2. What user experience outcomes have been reported regarding safety, usability, acceptability, 
and attrition of self-guided VR therapy interventions for anxiety? 
RQ 3. What future research opportunities are available for self-guided VR therapy for anxiety?  
This review synthesises evidence on self-guided virtual reality (VR) therapy for anxiety, 
highlighting its effectiveness in reducing symptoms with small to large effect sizes and its moderate to 
high usability and acceptability in unsupervised settings, with minimal simulator sickness. It 
emphasises the engaging potential of interactive features, such as gamification and virtual therapists, 
while identifying a critical need for research on its effectiveness and user experience in 
underrepresented anxiety populations. This paper provides a comprehensive overview and outlines 
key directions for future research. 
 
 

 
2 Method 
This systematic review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) checklist (Page et al., 
2021). The protocol of this systematic review was prospectively registered online with PROSPERO 
on the 12 August 2024 (CRD42024569216). 
2.1 Eligibility Criteria 
This systematic review included peer-reviewed journal articles written in English that 
reported on a self-guided VR-based intervention study on participants with clinical or subclinical 
anxiety. The self-guided intervention needed to make use of immersive VR technology (i.e., HMD or 
CAVE). The study could have any research design (whether quantitative, qualitative, or mixed 
methods) and any comparator (e.g., they did or did not compare the use of the self-guided VR 
intervention to other therapist guided VR interventions or non-VR interventions such as waitlist 
control, psychotherapy, or pharmacotherapy). The study also needed to report on VR effectiveness 
outcomes on any standardized anxiety measure as well as participant user experience outcomes (i.e., 
safety, usability, acceptability, or attrition). 
2.2 Search Strategy 
Eligible articles were sought from the below scientific research databases from 1st January 
2012 to 18th June 2024: Cochrane Library, IEEE Explore Digital Library, PsycINFO, PubMED, 
Scopus, and Web of Science. Keywords used to search each database were (“virtual reality” or “VR”) 
and (“anxiety” or phobia”) and (“remote” or “self-help” or “self-guided” or “self-care” or “self-led”). 
Search filters of English language and article type (i.e., journal articles and exclude review articles 
and protocol registrations) were applied where available in each database. Finally, a manual search of 
the reference lists of each included article was also performed.   
 
 

 
2.3 Article Selection 
Database search results were exported, deduplicated, and then screened on title and abstract 
information.  Promising articles were short-listed and obtained for full-text appraisal against eligibility 
criteria. Final study inclusion was agreed upon by all members of the research team. 
2.4 Data Extraction and Analysis 
A standardized coding sheet developed by one reviewer (JK) was used to guide data 
extraction from the eligible articles. Data items for extraction included: reference source (authors, 
publication title and year); study design (methodology, comparators, and measurement time points, 
such as pre-test, post-test, and any longitudinal follow-up); population (country of origin, sample size, 
and demographics); VR intervention information (name, virtual environments, hardware, content, and 
treatment details, such as number of VR therapy sessions and their time length); effectiveness results 
(methodological quality, measure names, outcomes and treatment effect sizes); and participant user 
experience findings (acceptability, safety, attrition, usability, and intention-to-treat analyses). Attrition 
in this review was defined and measured as the relative number of participants who started using the 
self-guided VR intervention at pre-test but did not complete measurements at post-test. Data were 
extracted and checked by two reviewers (RD, WG) to reduce reviewer bias and correct any potential 
data extraction errors. 
The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used to assess the quality of all included studies 
(Hong et al., 2018). This critical appraisal tool involves categorising each study based on research 
design (i.e., randomized controlled trial [RCT], non-randomised quantitative study, quantitative 
descriptive study, qualitative study, and mixed methods study). Each study has two screening 
questions and then five questions on methodological quality based on their respective category.  
Extracted data from the included studies were tabulated for analysis. As the observed findings 
involved a mix of quantitative and qualitative data obtained from diverse methodologies, a narrative 
synthesis approach was adopted for this review rather than statistical meta-analysis (Siddaway et al., 

2019). The narrative synthesis approach involves answering the review’s research questions using text 
to summarise and explain the findings of the included studies.  
3 Results 
3.1 Study Selection 
Figure 1 shows that the literature search yielded 414 records. A total of 244 remained after 
de-duplicating citations. Of these records, 21 articles met the eligibility criteria after screening based 
on title, abstract, and full-text appraisal. There were 19 unique studies found on self-guided VR 
therapy for anxiety. Two articles (Donker et al., 2020; Kahlon et al., 2023b) are additional reports on 
other included studies in the review.

3.2 Participant Characteristics 
Participants details across the included studies can be seen in Table 1. Participants were 
recruited from twelve countries of origin, with the largest proportion of participants from the 
Netherlands (N = 243), followed by New Zealand (N = 126), Norway (N = 100), the USA (N = 98) 
and UK (N = 80). Other countries with smaller representations include Sweden (N = 75), Iran (N = 
70), Japan (N = 70), South Korea (N = 54), Germany (N = 38), Italy (N = 40), and Canada (N = 6). 
Sample sizes ranged from 6 to 193 participants, with a median of 40 participants. Participant ages 
ranged from 12 – 67 years. Participants were mainly female with an average sample proportion of 
69.76% (range 24% to 90%). Both clinical (76.9%, N = 769) and non-clinical (23.1%, N = 231) 
studies were conducted. Most participants had anxiety, for example, public speaking anxiety, social 
anxiety disorder, a specific phobia, or panic disorder. However, some studies focused on other mental 
illnesses, such as depression, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder, PTSD, or chronic pain, and only 
measured anxiety as a secondary outcome. In clinical studies, diagnoses were obtained by 
questionnaires or clinical interviews delivered in person, by phone, or videoconferencing. In contrast, 
non-clinical studies focused on stress, fear related to COVID-19, varied measures of psychological 
distress or negative emotional states. Two non-clinical studies (N = 100 participants) specified a major 
mental illness as an exclusion criteria.

Table 1 shows that participant VR use was appraised in quantitative RCT studies (n = 10, 
52.63%), quantitative nonrandomized studies (n = 7, 36.84%), and mixed methods studies (n = 2, 
10.53%). Seven studies used a single-group research design. To collect data on VR outcomes, all 
studies used surveys or scales, four studies used semi-structured interviews (Khaleghi et al., 2024; 
Meyer et al., 2022; Miller et al., 2023; Riches et al., 2024), four studies obtained direct user 
commentary (Chard et al., 2023; Lacey et al., 2022; Piercey et al., 2012; Zainal et al., 2021), and three 

studies collected user engagement data during experimentation (Donker et al., 2020; Miller et al., 
2023; Veling et al., 2021). Comparators included waitlist, no treatment control group, an online 
exposure program, online psychoeducation, therapist-led VR, cognitive behavioural therapy app, and 
relaxation exercise. All studies had pre-test and post-test assessments on user outcomes, though 14 
also had follow-up assessments, and seven had assessments during the active VR test phase.  
3.4 Details of the Virtual Reality Interventions 
Table 2 shows that most studies tested a unique VR intervention, except for studies that 
conducted the same research in Iran (Farahimanesh et al., 2023), Germany (Meyer et al., 2022), and 
Italy (Riva et al., 2023). Hardware involved a standard computer, smartphone, and HMDs, which 
ranged from inexpensive cardboard VR viewers to more expensive headsets such as Oculus Quest 1, 
Samsung Gear VR headset, or a Pico Interactive Goblin VR headset. The software involved passive or 
active virtual environments with audio, video, text, interactivity, and educational content. The passive 
virtual environments entailed watching relaxing or pleasant videos such as virtual gardens, beaches, 
mountains, or ocean scenes. Active virtual environments typically involve graded exposure to treat 
public speaking anxiety, social anxiety disorder, or a broad range of phobias including fear of cats, 
dogs, spiders, heights, flying, and needles. Treatment lengths ranged from a single session to five 
weeks, with a mode of three weeks of VR. Participant VR usage time ranged from two minutes to 
three hours per session or module, and two studies delivered the VR in a single session.

3.5 Effectiveness Measures and Outcomes 
Details of the measures and outcomes of VR treatment on anxiety are summarised in Table 3. 
Most studies (n = 16, 76.19%) reported a significant reduction from pre-test to post-test VR-based 
treatment on standardised anxiety measure. VR treatment effect sizes across all studies that reported 
them ranged from small to large in magnitude.

There was a significant reduction in public speaking anxiety for both therapist-led and 
self-led VRET interventions. On average, participants in the therapist-led group 
experienced a reduction in public speaking anxiety that was 6.90 points greater than the 
waitlist/self-led group, at each treatment step. Following the therapist-led VRET (or 
equivalent waiting period), there was a 6.17-point difference between the groups, with a 
large between-group effect size of d = 0.83 and a medium within-group effect size of d = 
0.77. After the in-vivo transition program (or equivalent waiting period), this difference 
rose to 12.99 points, with a large between-group effect size of d = 1.50 and a large 
within-group effect size of d = 1.67. After the therapist-led VRET and in vivo 
intervention was complete, the waitlist group commenced self-led VRET. After 
participants completed the self-led VRET, there was an average reduction of 8.91 points 
in public speaking anxiety scores, with a large within-group effect size of d = 1.38. After 
completing the in-vivo transition program, the average reduction increased to 15.7 points, 
with a large within-group effect size of d = 1.35. The self-led group showed no 
significant decrease in anxiety between post-intervention and 6-month follow-up (p =

changes at 3 and 6-month follow-ups. 
 
3.6 User Experiences Outcomes 
The average attrition rate across studies in the self-guided VR treatment phase from pre-test 
to post-test was 16.18%, ranging from 0 to 50% (see Table 4). Three studies did not report attrition 
rates, and 10 studies reported an intention-to-treat analysis. Most studies used non-standardised 
questions on VR user experience factors of satisfaction, acceptability, user-experience, and user-
preferences. Six studies used the standardised Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (Donker et al., 2019; 
Lindner et al., 2020; Meyer et al., 2022; Shin et al., 2021; Veling et al., 2021; Zainal et al., 2021) and 
6 included studies used standardised measures on VR user presence. These measures included the 
Presence Questionnaire (Piercy et al., 2012), Igroup Presence Questionnaire (Donker et al., 2019; 

2020; Zainal et al., 2021), Gatineau Presence Scale (Lindner et al., 2020), and Sense of Presence 
Scale (Riches et al., 2024).

Several participants experienced discomfort 
using cardboard headsets. Several 
participants reported that the exercises 
lacked applicability to their personal 
experience of anxiety. Consequently, one 
participant did not feel anxious during VR 
sessions and ceased treatment while 
another did not feel connected to the virtual 
therapist.

The VR-CBT app received a user-friendly 
rating (mean [SD] = 75.35 [14.74], n = 55), 
indicating it is a highly effective and usable 
system. The VR-CBT participants provided 
an average Igroup Presence Questionnaire 
score of 42.69 (10.40). There were 24 
participants who reported one or more 
symptoms of transient cybersickness. 
According to the user experience results, 
there is a greater decrease in acrophobia 
symptoms when the usability of the app is 
high and there is a greater sense of 
presence. Most participants (n = 47; 72.3%) 
progressed through all five levels and on 
average, participants practiced each level 
twice and the maximum number of sessions 
spent on a level was 11. demonstrating that 
the app was engaging and could motivate 
repeated usage of VR self-guided CBT.

the program contained too much passive 
reading or listening to content.  
 
A total of 17% (5/30) of participants 
experienced adverse side effects from the 
Spark program. All reported issues related 
to the VR component, including headaches 
(3 participants), feelings of dissociation (1 
participant), and dizziness and eye pain (1 
participant).      
 
Participants developed a therapeutic 
connection with the digital character that 
led them through the mobile app. 
Participants likened the digital character to 
a role model (e.g., a teacher or therapist), 
who offered guidance and support, aided 
their understanding, and helped them 
maintain a sense of responsibility for their 
progress.

3.7 Quality Assessment Results 
In most RCT studies, randomisation was appropriately performed, and participants reportedly 
adhered to their assigned VR intervention. One study did not specify the procedure used to randomise 
participants to conditions (Khaleghi et al., 2024). Seven RCT studies either did not report a 
comparable baseline group analysis, or complete outcome date defined as > 80% (Chard et al., 2023; 
Donker et al., 2019; Donker et al., 2020; Lindner et al., 2019, Kahlon et al., 2023a; Kahlon et al., 
2023b and Shin et al., 2021). One study (Shin et al., 2021) reported blinding of outcome assessors, 
which was applied at pre-test measurements. All of the quantitative non-randomised studies utilised 
validated standard scales, administered the interventions as intended, and used appropriate statistical 
analyses. While most of these studies had outcome data defined as > 80% (Lindner et al., 2020; 
Matsumoto et al., 2021; Premkumar et al., 2021; Riva et al., 2021), others had unspecified or high 
attrition and dropout rates (Meyer et al., 2022; Piercey et al., 2012; Senda et al., 2023). Strengths of 
recruitment included use of clear inclusion and exclusion criteria, standardised scales with cut off 
scores, and use of multiple sources to access participants. The two mixed methods studies (Miller et 
al., 2022; Riches et al., 2024) utilised appropriate qualitative theory and methods to guide their 
investigation. However, the quantitative phase of one study (Riches et al., 2024) was underpowered 
due to a small sample size, preventing pre-post analyses of wellbeing outcomes from being conducted 
as planned. Non-probability sampling methods, such as snowballing and convenience sampling, were 

used in some studies (e.g., Khaleghi et al., 2024; Meyer et al., 2020; Piercey et al., 2012; Premkumar 
et al., 2021).  
4 Discussion 
4.1 Effectiveness of Self-Guided VR Therapy for Anxiety 
A primary aim of our systematic review was to examine the effectiveness of self-guided VR 
interventions for anxiety treatment. The findings suggest that self-guided VR interventions are 
generally effective in reducing anxiety symptoms, as 16 out of 21 studies reported significant 
improvements on standardised measures. Effect sizes ranged from small to large, could be rapidly 
procured, and all significant reductions in anxiety were sustained at all follow-up measurements. 
Improvements were obtained for people with public speaking anxiety, social anxiety disorder, specific 
phobia, depression, bipolar, a psychotic disorder, and sub-clinical anxiety symptoms. These findings 
are consistent with previous VR research into anxiety disorders and especially research into social 
anxiety disorder that relies on graded exposure sessions to reduce anxiety (Jingili et al., 2023; 
Krzstanek et al., 2021). However, it is unclear if the effectiveness results would be maintained beyond 
12 months. There were also few studies that focused on children and adolescents, which limits the 
generalisability of findings. Nonetheless, the findings indicate that self-guided VR therapy for anxiety 
can help clinicians provide effective stepped care and overcome common treatment barrier issues, 
such as worker shortages, geographical distance, and long waitlists. 
Conversely, five studies in our review did not find a significant reduction in a measure of 
anxiety. Chard et al. (2023) reported no significant change with participants who had social anxiety 
disorder treated with three weeks of exposure sessions. Previous research into therapist guided VR 
interventions to address social anxiety disorder, found that 8 to 12 sessions are more often associated 
with a significant reduction in social anxiety disorder symptoms (Krzystanek et al., 2021). Therefore, 
it is possible that more self-guided VRET sessions may be required to significantly reduce social 
anxiety disorder. Furthermore, Khaleghi et al. (2024) reported no significant change in cat phobia 
after sessions of self-guided VR exposure therapy that lasted up to three hours. Research suggests that 
even one long session of up to 45-180 minutes can be effective for treating phobias (Krzystanek et al., 

2021), yet the small sample size (n = 10) in Khaleghi et al. (2024) may have reduced the likelihood of 
detecting significant effects. Moreover, three of the other studies that did not detect a significant 
decrease in anxiety also had small sample sizes (Chard et al., 2023; Matsumoto et al., 2021; Senda et 
al., 2023). Also, three of the five studies delivered virtual environments that focused on pleasant 
environments, relaxation, or mindfulness (Matsumoto et al., 2021; Riva et al., 2021; Senda et al., 
2023). In contrast, anxiety reductions were observed in studies that used active VR for exposure 
therapy. For instance, 11 of 13 (85%) VRET studies reported significant reductions compared to 6 of 
8 (75%) relaxation VR intervention studies. This highlights for clinicians a key effectiveness 
difference between self-guided VR therapy interventions for anxiety that are active (e.g., interactive 
exposure) versus passive (e.g., watching relaxing scenes). 
4.2 User Experience of Self-Guided VR Therapy for Anxiety 
Another primary aim of our systematic review was to examine the user experience of self-
guided VR interventions for anxiety. It is encouraging that self-guided VR interventions were 
generally able to safely procure reductions in anxiety symptoms in unsupervised settings (e.g., 
participants’ homes). There were no reports of major safety problems such as harmful falls or 
colliding with real-world objects, repetitive strain injuries, or hygiene issues. This could partially be 
due to studies making use of self-selecting samples of people already familiar with VR use or the 
screening out of participants with certain conditions. Nevertheless, the absence of major safety 
problems was found among participants who reported no prior experience with VR (e.g., see Lindner 
et al., 2020; Shin et al., 2023). It is possible that some participants may have received help from others 
(e.g., friends or family members familiar with VR) during their VR treatment. However, the findings 
imply that people may be adequately supported with the provision of safety instructions prior to VR 
use or within the VR software itself, such as the removal of dangerous objects and what to do if 
experiencing simulator sickness (Donker et al., 2020; Lindner et al., 2020). Interestingly, some 
participants described that while the program was self-guided, they felt like the digital character that 
guided them through the VR treatment was watching over them (Miller et al., 2023).  

Notably, there were limited reports of simulator sickness. A few studies reported participants 
stopping the use of VR due to side effects, such as motion sickness and nausea (Senda et al., 2023; 
Veling et al., 2021). Therefore, self-guided VR therapy is not appropriate for all anxious clients. 
However, Shin et al. (2021) found that lower SSQ scores were significantly associated with the 
number of VR sessions participants performed. Therefore, it is possible that participants may 
acclimatise to the VR experience with repeated use and persevere through simulator sickness to 
achieve reduced anxiety. Importantly, no significant deterioration in anxiety symptoms were reported 
in any reviewed study from pre- to post-test, despite the potential conflation between anxiety and 
simulator sickness sharing physiological markers, such as dizziness and nausea (Senda et al., 2023; 
Veling et al., 2021). This implies that any simulator sickness symptoms are short-lived and will not 
significantly worsen users’ anxiety levels after discontinuing VR use. Overall, the observed safety 
findings across the included studies in our review evince that self-guide VR therapy for anxiety can be 
a benign treatment modality for most clients who opt for this treatment approach. 
Regarding usability, participants reported that VR headsets were user friendly (Donker et al., 
2019) and that learning to use VR technology was remarkably easy (Khaleghi et al., 2024). Usability 
feedback tended to be more positive in VR interventions that actively focused on graded exposure to 
treat social anxiety disorder, public speaking anxiety, or a specific phobia. Conversely, the usability 
feedback tended to be more negative in passive VR interventions that focused on relaxing scenes, 
pleasant images, or mindfulness. Participants were more likely to stop VR interventions due to the 
repetitiveness or monotony of the passive virtual environments (Riches et al., 2024), and others 
provided feedback that the VR environments contained too much passive reading or listening to 
content, and that it needed to be more interactive (Miller et al., 2023). Furthermore, participants who 
used the inexpensive cardboard VR headsets were more likely to complain of usability issues due to 
discomfort and lack of immersion from the cardboard headsets (Chard et al., 2023), low display 
quality and resolution (Meyer et al., 2022), and technical glitches that hindered participants’ 
experience (Riches et al., 2024). Therefore, clinicians recommending self-guided VR therapy to their 

anxious clients are likely to obtain better usability feedback if the intervention involves higher quality 
HMDs and interactive treatment elements in the virtual environments.   
Our review findings indicate that anxious people who complete self-guided VR interventions 
tend to find them acceptable. Many participants reported they would personally use VR interventions 
in the future for any anxiety issues, and they would recommend VR interventions to other people who 
struggled with a similar issue (Donker et al., 2020; Lindner et al., 2020; Meyer et al., 2022; Zainal et 
al., 2021). However, measures of acceptability were often elicited post-treatment after participants 
successfully completed the treatment protocol. It is probable that attrition occurred for some people 
because the VR interventions were perceived to be unacceptable (e.g., lacked effectiveness, poor 
usability, or were deemed unsafe). Therefore, the results on acceptability may be subject to 
survivorship bias because they did not capture acceptability feedback from participants who dropped 
out during the treatment.  
Self-guided VR therapy for anxiety appears to be an engaging treatment modality. The 
average attrition rate observed in our review was lower than self-guided internet interventions for 
anxiety, such as people receiving therapy through websites (Donker et al., 2013). Nonetheless, a 
higher attrition rate for self-guided VR treatment compared to therapist-guided VR treatment was 
found (Lindner et al., 2019). Therefore, it is likely rapport with a therapist may assist treatment 
adherence and reduce dropout rates (Horigome et al., 2020). Also, Senda et al. (2023) reported the 
highest rate of attrition from pre- to post-test (50%) over a 2-week treatment period. However, their 
participants had a combination of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and chronic pain conditions. Previous 
research found that VRET was less effective in reducing anxiety when users had co-morbid illnesses 
to manage (Krzystanek et al., 2021).  
4.6 Future Research Directions 
There are many future research opportunities for self-guided VR therapy for anxiety. To 
enhance user engagement, future studies can consider including and examining interactive 
gamification elements (e.g., puzzles, challenges, interactive scenarios, digital points or badge rewards 
for completing tasks, social interaction where users can compete with others or share their progress 

with friends or family, and personalisation whereby users can customise avatars and environments 
Jingili et al., 2023). Comparative research between self-guided VR interventions and other types of 
self-help (e.g., internet interventions, bibliography) would help clarify for clinicians which would be 
most effective for providing stepped care to their anxious clients (Haug et al., 2012). Longitudinal 
research beyond 12 months can help determine the need and potential effectiveness of VR booster 
treatments. There were also a lack of studies examining the use of self-guided VR therapy for anxiety 
within an Australian context. Whilst survey research suggests most Australian mental health 
practitioners are aware of VR technology (91%), fewer are familiar with applications to clinical care 
(40%; Chung et al., 2022). VR interventions have high ratings of acceptability (84%) and 
appropriateness (69%), but lower ratings of feasibility (59%), with concern that those without 
technological knowledge may show low interest and engagement in treatment (Chung et al., 2022). 
Therefore, further research is required to examine practitioner perceptions, knowledge, familiarity, 
and attitudes towards self-guided VR therapy for anxiety, as well as directly test concerns raised about 
their use within the Australian mental health workforce. 
The review found one study that developed a VR program suitable for the treatment of 
multiple phobias (Lacey et al., 2023). Further research is necessary in this area, as 75% of people with 
specific phobia are afraid of several objects or situations, with an average of three feared stimuli 
triggering distress and active avoidance (APA, 2022; Stinson, 2007). In a similar vein, studies tended 
to exclude individuals with comorbidities, so little is known about how to adapt self-guided VRET 
programs to suit complex cases. Since self-guided VRET has demonstrated effectiveness for treating 
social anxiety disorder and specific phobias, future research should also target groups at elevated risk 
of these conditions. For instance, autism spectrum disorder frequently co-occurs with social anxiety 
(17%) and specific phobia (30%; APA, 2022); therefore, research should investigate the effectiveness 
and user experience of self-guided VR programs for anxious people with autism. Further research 
should also target young people, as social anxiety disorder and most specific phobias have an onset 
during early development; and phobias a less likely to resolve if they continue into adulthood (APA, 
2022). While Miller et al. (2022) found parents agreed that self-led VR could be incorporated into 

their child’s routine, little is known about the nature or extent of the parents’ involvement in 
supporting their child or adolescent’s engagement in VR without therapist guidance. 
4.7 Strengths and Limitations of the Review 
This systematic review consolidates available peer-reviewed journal evidence on the use of 
self-guided VR therapy for anxiety. It has a structured and replicable framework by adopting the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Systematic 
Reviews checklist (Page et al., 2021). Our review utilised a broad and comprehensive search strategy 
that involved multiple reviewers, which improves the validity and reliability of the observed findings. 
The protocol of this systematic review was prospectively registered online with PROSPERO to 
minimize selective outcome reporting bias. Nonetheless, this review has several limitations. The limit 
of English-language studies may have excluded relevant articles published in other languages. The 
limit of peer-review journal articles may have eliminated other types of literature such as conference 
presentations, and dissertations. It is also possible that the initial screening of articles based on the 
title and abstract may have inadvertently eliminated pertinent articles if the keywords and information 
provided did not clearly relate to self-guided VR for anxiety.  
5 Conclusion 
Self-guided VR therapy for anxiety can reduce symptoms across multiple conditions. Small-
to-large treatment effects were observed that could last beyond treatment cessation. Interactive VRET 
tended to have improved effectiveness and user experience outcomes over passive VR experiences 
(e.g., watching relaxing environments). A lack of effectiveness was generally observed in studies with 
passive VR experiences, small sample sizes, and short treatment lengths. Whilst there were limited 
reports of simulator sickness, self-guided VR therapy was generally found to be engaging, safe, usable 
and acceptable to anxious people. Future research can help aid clinical decision making and treatment 
recommendations in this domain by recruiting larger sample sizes, targeting underrepresented anxiety 
disorder populations, iterating on existing applications to improve their interactive features, and 
comparing self-guided VR therapy against other established treatments (e.g., therapist guided, internet 

interventions, bibliotherapy). Overall, our review findings support the potential use of this treatment 
modality as a form of stepped care when therapist support is limited or unavailable.
