ABSTRACT
Anxiety is a common mental health condition characterised by excessive worry,
fear and apprehension about everyday situations. Even with significant progress
over the past few years, predicting anxiety from electroencephalographic (EEG)
signals, specifically using error-related negativity (ERN), still remains challenging.
Following the PRISMA protocol, this paper systematically reviews 54 research
papers on using EEG and ERN markers for anxiety detection published in the
last 10 years (2013 – 2023). Our analysis highlights the wide usage of traditional
machine learning, such as support vector machines and random forests, as well as
deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural
networks across different data types. Our analysis reveals that the development
of a robust and generic anxiety prediction method still needs to address real-
world challenges, such as task-specific setup, feature selection and computational
modelling. We conclude this review by offering potential future direction for
non-invasive, objective anxiety diagnostics, deployed across diverse populations
and anxiety sub-types.

Introduction
Anxiety is endemic to every person, with an occurrence rate of approximately 20% [World Health
Organization, 2017]. Between 2020 and 2022, over one in six people (17.2% or 3.4 million people)
aged 16 to 85 years experienced an anxiety disorder [Australian Bureau of Statistics]. Anxiety
is caused by changes in the situation, nervousness and common symptoms, including sweating,
trembling and excessive worrying, which affect a person’s daily life. Anxiety disorders encompass a
range of conditions, such as generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), social anxiety
disorder (SAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), various phobia-related disorders, physical
pain related protective behaviour [Li et al., 2020, 2021] and depression [Ghosh and Anwar, 2021].
Current clinical approaches for diagnosing these disorders often suffer from limitations in accuracy
and objectivity, relying heavily on self-reports, patient histories and clinical observations. These
methods can be subjective and may not capture the nuanced neural and behavioural patterns associated
with anxiety, leading to potential misdiagnoses. Recent research has shown promising results in using
machine learning techniques to detect anxiety through physiological analysis [Abd-Alrazaq et al.,
2023], such as respiration, electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG), electrodermal
response (EDA) and electroencephalography (EEG), to identify patterns associated with anxiety
states [Abd-Alrazaq et al., 2023].

Machine learning techniques are increasingly employed in mental health to understand complex
patterns [Meyer et al., 2015]. Machine learning models can be analysed in various data types,
including physiological signals, behavioural patterns and self-reported symptoms, to identify patterns
indicative of anxiety disorders [Sanei and Chambers, 2007, Crawford et al., 2020]. Some commonly
used machine learning models are support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), logistic
regression, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). These
models have shown promise in analysing complex data modalities, including EEG signals, and
medical imaging, for the diagnosis and prediction of mental health disorders [Mughal et al., 2020].
Numerous reviews exist across mental health domains, including depression, anxiety and stress.
However, there is a scarcity of comprehensive review papers specifically focusing on classifying
anxiety disorders using EEG and error-related negativity (ERN) markers with machine learning
models. For instance, Al-Ezzi et al. [2020] reviewed EEG, event-related potential (ERP) and brain
connectivity in SAD, while Michael et al. [2021] systematically reviewed ERN and CRN (correct-
response negativity) related to attentional control in anxiety disorders. Additionally, de Bardeci et al.
[2021] explored deep learning methods applied to EEG data across various mental disorders. Despite
these efforts, there remains a notable absence of a holistic review covering various anxiety disorders
using EEG and ERN with machine learning models.
Our approach adheres to the standard methodology of conducting a systematic literature review. We
first formulated search keywords and queried eight databases, including Web of Science, Neuroscience
and IEEE Xplore, yielding 986 papers. These papers underwent rigorous screening against three
exclusion criteria through thorough title-and-abstract and full-text evaluations. Ultimately, 54 papers
were selected for comprehensive review in this study. Our analysis is structured in two different
ways: (1) EEG using machine learning models, and (2) ERN using statistical analysis. Our major
contributions include:
1. We provide an overview of the tasks and subjects utilised for data collection to leverage
machine learning in anxiety detection.
2. We thoroughly review all EEG and ERN-based machine learning models employed in
various anxiety disorder studies published between 2013 and 2023.
3. We offer detailed insights and future research direction into detection of various anxiety
disorders, including GAD, SAD, OCD and PD, specifically examining EEG and ERN
markers.

Preliminaries
2.1
Types of Anxiety Disorders
This paper focused on four major types of anxiety disorders: generalised anxiety disorder (GAD),
social anxiety disorder (SAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and panic disorder (PD) [Na-
tional Institute of Mental Health]. Figure 1 illustrates the worldwide annual prevalence rates of
anxiety disorders. GAD arises from multiple sources, leading to pervasive fear and anxiety in affected
individuals. This disorder causes sufferers to feel anxious even about everyday activities [Schacter
et al., 2011]. SAD is characterised by a fear of being judged in social situations. In these situations,
individuals with social anxiety display more anxious behaviours and heightened autonomic arousal
and report higher levels of distress compared to those without anxiety [Barker et al., 2015]. People
with PD experience frequent and unexpected panic attacks. These attacks involve sudden surges
of fear or discomfort, or a feeling of losing control, even when there is no obvious threat or cause
[National Institute of Mental Health]. OCD is a chronic condition where a person has persistent
and uncontrollable thoughts (obsessions) and engages in repetitive actions (compulsions), or both.
These symptoms can be time-consuming, leading to significant distress and disruptions in daily life
[National Institute of Mental Health].
2.2
Electroencephalogram (EEG)
Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a non-invasive and cost-effective technique for measuring electro-
physiological activity [Aldayel and Al-Nafjan, 2024]. This non-invasive technique is well-suited
for investigating the electrophysiological and cognitive conditions of the human brain [Aldayel and
Al-Nafjan, 2024]. It involves placing electrodes on the scalp to detect the neuronal activity. EEG has
become a crucial tool for studying the dynamic patterns of brain activity and is increasingly used in
clinical mental health assessments. Its potential extends to detecting various emotions, stress levels,
anxiety and diverse brain disorders [Meyer, 2016]. EEG studies of anxiety disorders often focus
on brain activity in the frontal lobe region. This area is associated with cognitive functions such as
decision-making, emotion regulation and attentional control, which are often disrupted in individuals
with anxiety disorders [Meyer, 2017, Falkenstein et al., 1991]. Evaluating anxiety using EEG in-
volves several steps: data collection, data pre-processing, feature extraction and detection of anxiety.
Feature extraction and detection are the two main components of a standard EEG anxiety evaluation
approach. There are three types of domain-based EEG features: time-domain, frequency-domain and
time-frequency domain [Mazlan et al., 2024].
2.3
Error-Related Negativity (ERN)
Event-related potential or electrical brain response is time-locked to the specific event or stimuli
obtained from EEG signals. It consists of various components that reflect different brain information
stages [Gehring et al., 1993, Brázdil et al., 2005]. One specific ERP component is error-related
negativity (ERN), which is a negative deflection in the EEG waveform that occurs within a specific
window following the completion of the error. ERN is typically observed at frontocentral electrode
sites and indicates the activity of the anterior cingulate cortex [Dehaene et al., 1994, Hajcak et al.,
2004]. The negative peak in the EEG waveform occurs approximately (50–100 ms) after the
commission of errors. Several studies have shown that the amplitude of the ERN is very sensitive
to anxiety-related disorders [Hajcak et al., 2003, Meyer et al., 2012]. Larger ERN amplitude is
associated with negative effects and transdiagnostic characteristics of anxiety disorders and is more
pronounced in various anxiety disorders [Moser et al., 2013, Carrasco, 2012] such as OCD [Endrass
et al., 2014, 2010], SAD [Kujawa et al., 2016, Weinberg et al., 2012] and GAD [Xiao et al., 2011,
Wiswede et al., 2009].

3.2
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were established to ensure the selection of relevant studies for the
systematic review. Studies were included if they met all three predefined criteria: (1) participants
diagnosed with clinical anxiety disorders such as GAD, SAD, PD, OCD and any other anxiety
disorders, (2) use of EEG and ERP measures related to anxiety disorders; and (3) studies conducted
between 2013 and 2023. Furthermore, reviews summarising primary studies on mixed anxiety
disorders, particularly those administered by clinicians, trained professionals or volunteer participants,
were also included in the study selection process. Exclusion criteria were applied to filter out studies
that did not meet the objectives of the review. Specifically, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and
review papers were excluded from the analysis. Additionally, studies addressing comorbidities of
anxiety with depression and stress were excluded.
3.3
Screening Result
The search yielded 986 articles on anxiety across multiple databases, which included 191 duplicates.
After abstract screening of 796 articles, 190 articles went to next stage for full-text screening. Among
these, 106 articles focused on mixed anxiety disorder using EEG with machine learning models, and
183 articles were on mixed anxiety using various event-related potential components, including ERN.
After the full-text screening phase, 28 met the inclusion criteria for EEG-based studies, while 26
met the criteria for ERP studies. Figure 2 illustrates the flow of number of papers in our screening
process.

Data Collection Strategies in Classifying Anxiety Disorders
Table 1 illustrates various data types that can be used to train machine learning algorithms, including
information from questionnaires, interviews, demographic data, medical records, treatment histories
and anxiety rating scales. This review focuses on wearable technology, demographics, channels,
scale(s), and tasks that are used for the collection of EEG signals.
4.1
Electroencephalogram (EEG)
EEG data were collected using a 16-channel system (Nicolet EEG TS215605) while subjects remained
awake and relaxed with their eyes closed for ten minutes [Shen et al., 2022]. Al-Ezzi et al. [2023]
collected the data using a referential 32-channel cap (ANT Neuro) during a six-minute resting state
with participants’ eyes closed in a quiet, dimly-lit room. The channels covered prefrontal, temporal,
parietal, and occipital regions. Participants were categorised based on SIAS scores for SAD and were
all right-handed, healthy, and medication-free. Muhammad and Al-Ahmadi [2022] utilised an Emotiv
EPOC wireless headset with 14 electrodes during a 6-minute exposure therapy session involving
anxiety-inducing scenarios and self-assessment tasks. Participants, 23 healthy adults (10 males, 13
females) with an average age of 30, reported anxiety levels using the HAM-A and SAM scales. The
channels included AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, and AF4 [Muhammad
and Al-Ahmadi, 2022].
Mou et al. [2024] also used the HAM-A and DSM-V scales with a 16-electrode (Nicolet EEG
TS215605) system but focused specifically on resting state tasks. Their research compared individuals
with Anxiety disorders and those with GAD. Wang et al. [2022] conducted another related study,
using the DSM-V and HAM-A scales during close, awake, and relax tasks with the same (Nicolet
EEG TS215605) system. They compared brain activity between younger and older GAD patients,
contributing to an understanding of how age-related factors influence anxiety disorders [Wang et al.,
2022]. Conversely, Liu et al. [2023] took this a step further by employing a 128-channel Electrical
Geodesic Instrument, although they focused on behavioural data related to eye-opening and closing
tasks rather than anxiety-specific scales like DSM-V or HAM-A. This approach potentially allowed
for more precise localisation of brain activity patterns, though it diverged from the anxiety-focused
scales used in the other studies. Overall, these studies highlight the widespread use of the HAM-A
and DSM-V scales in conjunction with EEG systems to explore the neural correlates of anxiety.
The consistent use of resting state tasks, particularly with the Nicolet EEG system, underscores the
importance of this approach in identifying biomarkers for anxiety disorders. Moreover, variations
in EEG channel numbers across studies suggest that while more channels can offer greater spatial
resolution, the 16-electrode setup remains a popular choice for balancing complexity with practical
data collection and analysis.
4.2
Error-Related Negativity (ERN)
Several studies have employed the BioSemi ActiveTwo system to explore pediatric and volunteer
populations’ responses to various cognitive tasks. For example, Carrasco et al. [2013] used this system
with pediatric OCD and anxiety patients during an arrow flanker task, focusing on two electrode
sites (FCz and Cz) and employing scales like the CBCL, MASC, and CDI to assess behavioural
outcomes. Similarly, Meyer et al. [2015] examined child volunteers using Go/No-go, flanker, and
Stroop tasks with five electrode sites. Their study utilised the SCARED scale to measure anxiety
and response control. Riesel et al. [2014]extended this methodology by using a 64-channel BioSemi
system to investigate volunteers during Go/No-go and flanker tasks. They used the DSM-IV scale,
indicating a broader exploration of anxiety-related responses across different tasks. Other studies
have leveraged the Geodesics Sensor Cap with high channel counts to investigate anxiety-related
responses. For example, Kaczkurkin [2013] used a 128-channel setup to study volunteers in a letter
flanker task, focusing on Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory scores (OCI-R). Likewise, Larson et al.
[2013] examined GAD and healthy control populations during flanker tasks with a 128-channel
system, employing both the BDI-II and STAI scales to assess anxiety and depression.
Hum et al. [2013] also used a 128-channel Geodesics Sensor Cap with clinically anxious children
during Go/No-go flanker tasks, combining CBCL, MASC and STAIC-S scales to measure anxiety
severity and cognitive control. The choice of systems and tasks varied significantly, with Zambrano-
Vazquez and Allen [2014] using the two-channel Neuroscan Synamps system for flanker tasks,

system to study GAD, OCD, and major depressive disorder (MDD) patients during cognitive tasks,
broadening the scope of mental health research. Similarly, Kujawa et al. [2016] used a 34-channel
BioSemi system for flanker tasks across several populations (SAD, GAD, HC, AD), focusing on
the DSM-IV scale. Overall, these studies emphasise the importance of EEG systems like BioSemi
and Geodesics Sensor Cap in exploring anxiety and cognitive control across various populations.
The different scales (e.g., CBCL, STAI, DSM-IV) reflect a comprehensive approach to measuring
psychological responses, providing valuable insights into the neural correlates of anxiety and related
disorders.

Feature Extraction and Anxiety Detection
5.1
Error-Related Negativity (ERN)
Feature selection was applied before feeding all features into the anxiety detection algorithms to
explore whether there are subsets of features that offer improved detection. Carrasco et al. [2013]
examined enlarged ERN amplitudes as a neurophysiological feature in youth with OCD, GAD
and SAD. ERN amplitude was compared between three groups using ANOVA with an error trail.
Meyer et al. [2015] assessed the ERN, CRN and ∆ERN (difference between ERN and CRN) as
neurophysiological features measured at electrodes Fz, Cz and Pz, alongside behavioural metrics
like reaction times and error rates. Statistical analysis used repeated-measures ANOVAs and logistic
regression to examine relationships between ∆ERN, child anxiety disorders and maternal anxiety
history. Riesel et al. [2019] analysed ERN and CRN amplitudes at electrodes Fz, Cz and Pz in OCD
patients, OCD relatives and healthy controls, using ANCOVA and repeated-measures ANCOVA to
account for age and response type. Hierarchical regressions explored the impact of family history
on ERN in unaffected participants. Results showed enhanced ERN in OCD patients and relatives
compared to control.
Kujawa et al. [2016] used mixed-design ANCOVAs to evaluate ∆ERN pre-and post-treatment in
anxiety patients (GAD and SAD) versus healthy controls, controlling for age and comorbid depression.
Behavioural performance was assessed by accuracy and reaction time (RT), revealing slower RTs
in patients compared to controls, though this difference was not significant post-treatment. Lo et al.
[2017] analysed EEG data from 64 electrodes to measure ERN and CRN, focusing on midline
sites (Fz, FCz, Cz, CPz, Pz) with a 0–100 ms post-response window. Mixed-design ANOVAs
revealed a significant ERN effect, with greater negativity for errors compared to correct responses,
and a notable ∆ERN at fronto-central sites. Behavioural measures showed faster responses on error
trials and increased post-error accuracy. Torpey et al. [2013] assessed ERN, and Pe, which was
measured across midline electrodes (Fz, Cz, Pz) and defined by average voltage during specific
post-response windows (0–100 ms for ERN, 200–500 ms for Pe). The difference in error-related
activity (∆ERN) was calculated by subtracting correct-trial from error-trial voltages. Simultaneous

regression analyses assessed relationships between ERP components, parental psychopathology and
child temperament, with age controlled for ∆ERN. Results showed typical task performance, with
faster reaction times for errors and maximal ∆ERN at Cz. Overall, these key features analysed
across studies include ERN, CRN and ∆ERN amplitudes measured at midline electrodes (Fz, Cz,
Pz), alongside behavioural metrics like reaction time and accuracy. Analytical methods involved
mixed-design ANOVAs, ANCOVAs and regression models to assess relationships between ERN
components, anxiety disorders, family history and treatment effects.
5.2
Electroencephalogram (EEG)
In recent years, several studies have explored different feature extraction techniques (Table 2) in EEG-
based machine learning models to improve the classification and detection of various neurological
and psychological conditions. The features used for analysis span time, frequency, and connectivity
domains, demonstrating a diverse approach to EEG signal processing.
One common feature extraction method is Power Spectral Density (PSD), which has been employed
across multiple studies. For instance, Gross et al. [2021] used PSD, frontal asymmetry index (FAI)
and sub-band information to assess brain activity, while Shen et al. [2022] combined PSD with
univariate analysis, fuzzy entropy and multivariate functional connectivity to extract meaningful EEG
features. Additionally, Park et al. [2021] used PSD alongside functional connectivity (FC) at different
frequency bands to study brain network alterations.
In addition to PSD, fuzzy entropy has emerged as a critical measure in EEG research. Al-Ezzi et al.
[2021] utilised fuzzy entropy values as a primary feature extraction method, while Shen et al. [2022]
included fuzzy entropy in combination with functional connectivity measures. Fuzzy entropy helps
quantify the complexity and unpredictability of EEG signals, which can be indicative of underlying
neurological conditions. Time domain features have also been widely adopted, offering insight
into the amplitude and signal characteristics over time. Arsalan et al. [2020]and Fang et al. [2024]
leveraged time-domain features, while Muhammad and Al-Ahmadi [2022] focused on extracting
frequency domain features such as mean power, rational asymmetry and asymmetry index. By
concentrating on the theta and beta bands, they were able to pinpoint critical frequency components
using a frequency band selection algorithm.
Other studies have explored more complex feature extraction techniques, such as effective connectivity
(EC) and phase lag index (PLI). Al-Ezzi et al. [2023] utilised EC features derived from cortical
correlation, which offers insight into the directed interactions between brain regions. Fang et al. [2024]
employed PLI, which measures phase synchronisation between EEG signals, revealing connectivity
patterns across different brain areas. The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is another widely used
feature extraction method. Aldayel and Al-Nafjan [2024] and Baghdadi et al. [2019, 2021] applied
DWT alongside PSD and other statistical features, such as Hjorth parameters, fractal dimension and
spectral entropy. DWT enables the decomposition of EEG signals into multiple frequency bands,
making it easier to capture both time and frequency information.
Complexity-based features like Lempel-Ziv complexity and correlation dimension have been ex-
plored in specific patient populations. For example, Aderinwale et al. [2023] studied these features
identifying lower complexity and correlation in these individuals compared to healthy controls.
Lastly, feature selection techniques such as recursive feature elimination and the wrapper method have
been used to optimise machine learning models by selecting the most relevant EEG features. Shikha
et al. [2021] and Muhammad and Al-Ahmadi [2022] employed these methods to enhance classification
performance by identifying the most significant features from large feature sets. Overall, the EEG
feature extraction techniques in machine learning span a wide range of methods, including time
and frequency domain features, complexity measures, connectivity indices and advanced statistical
methods

high accuracy of 97.55%. Similarly, Park et al. [2021] utilised SVM to analyse anxiety disorders,
reaching an accuracy of 91.03% using whole band PSD. Chen et al. [2021] also employed SVM with
an radial basis function (RBF) kernel and one-versus-one (OVO) strategy, achieving 92% accuracy.

Discussions and Future Directions
This review focuses on several key anxiety disorders, including generalised anxiety disorder (GAD)
and panic disorders (PD), exploring the use of electroencephalography (EEG) and error-related
negativity (ERN) in prior studies for anxiety detection. Despite the prevalence of research utilising
GAD signals to study anxiety, there is a notable scarcity of studies concentrating on panic disorders.
Most existing studies employ EEG data from all-over-channel electrode sites, yet anxiety disorders
primarily involve activity in the frontal electrode sites. This review identifies a gap in the literature
concerning the application of ERN with machine learning models, highlighting an area for further
exploration.
Feature extraction is a crucial step in EEG analysis, and the majority of anxiety detection approaches
in the literature rely on either time-domain or frequency-domain analysis. Some studies have reported
significant results using comprehensive electrode site data, yet the most informative features for
anxiety detection are often obtained from the frontal regions of the brain where ERN activity is
prominent.
Machine learning models have been extensively used for classifying EEG signals in anxiety disorder
studies. Support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF) models have demonstrated high
accuracy and performance in anxiety detection tasks. However, neural network architectures, particu-
larly long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have shown
superior accuracy compared to multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) and convolutional neural networks
(CNN) for this purpose. These findings suggest that advanced neural networks may offer improved
capabilities in capturing the temporal dynamics of EEG signals associated with anxiety disorders.
Lastly, significant advancements have been made in using EEG and ERN for anxiety detection,
future research should focus on addressing the identified gaps, such as the application of ERN with
machine learning and the investigation of panic disorders. Further exploration of EEG features
specific to anxiety subtypes and the utilisation of cutting-edge machine learning models will enhance
the precision and applicability of these diagnostic tools in clinical settings.

Conclusion
This research reviews an optimistic picture for the future of diagnosing and understanding anxiety
disorders through a combination of EEG, ERN analysis and machine learning. The studies explored
suggest that individuals with anxiety exhibit distinct patterns in their brain activity, particularly in
the realm of error detection. Machine learning models, when trained on this EEG data, have shown
promising accuracy in differentiating between healthy individuals and those with anxiety disorders.
This technology has the potential to revolutionise the diagnostic landscape, offering a non-invasive
and potentially objective method for identifying anxiety.
However, there are crucial areas that require further investigation. The studies reviewed primarily
focused on four specific disorders: GAD, OCD, PD and SAD. More research is needed to explore the
effectiveness of this approach in diagnosing panic disorder, where existing data is scarce. Additionally,
while the reviewed models achieved promising results, refining them further is important to improve
accuracy and generalisability across different populations. Looking forward, large-scale clinical trials
with diverse participants are essential to validate these findings and establish EEG-machine learning
as a reliable diagnostic tool. Further research should also delve deeper into the underlying neural
mechanisms that differentiate healthy brains from those with anxiety disorders. This knowledge
could pave the way for the development of more targeted treatment approaches. By harnessing the
power of EEG and machine learning, researchers hold the potential to significantly improve the lives
of millions struggling with anxiety disorders.
