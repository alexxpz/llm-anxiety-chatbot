Abstract 
Background: Digital phenotyping offers a novel and cost-efficient approach for managing depression 
and anxiety. Previous studies, often limited to small-to-medium or specific populations, may lack 
generalizability. 
 
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from 10,129 participants recruited from a UK-
based general population between June 2020 and August 2022. Participants shared wearable (Fitbit) data 
and self-reported questionnaires on depression (PHQ-8), anxiety (GAD-7), and mood via a study app. 
We first examined the correlations between PHQ-8/GAD-7 scores and wearable-derived features, 
demographics, health data, and mood assessments. Subsequently, unsupervised clustering was used to 
identify behavioural patterns associated with depression or anxiety. Finally, we employed separate 
XGBoost models to predict depression and anxiety and compared the results using different subsets of 
features. 
 
Results: We observed significant associations between the severity of depression and anxiety with 
several factors, including mood, age, gender, BMI, sleep patterns, physical activity, and heart rate. 
Clustering analysis revealed that participants simultaneously exhibiting lower physical activity levels 
and higher heart rates reported more severe symptoms. Prediction models incorporating all types of 
variables achieved the best performance (R2=0.41, MAE=3.42 for depression; R2=0.31, MAE=3.50 for 
anxiety) compared to those using subsets of variables.  
 
Limitations: Data collection during the COVID-19 pandemic may introduce biases, despite controlling 
for pandemic-related variables. 
 
Conclusion: This study identified potential indicators for depression and anxiety, highlighting the utility 
of digital phenotyping and machine learning technologies for rapid screening of mental disorders in 
general populations. These findings provide robust real-world insights for future healthcare applications.

1. Introduction 
Depression and anxiety are the most prevalent mental health disorders worldwide and leading causes of 
disability (Collaborators, 2022). These mental disorders are associated with adverse outcomes such as 
premature mortality, reduced quality of life, impaired occupational function, and increased suicide risk, 
thereby imposing significant burdens on society and individuals (Liu et al., 2020; Santomauro et al., 
2021). Traditional detection and monitoring methods, such as interviews and questionnaires, are often 
susceptible to subjective recall bias and fail to capture day-to-day fluctuations in behaviours and mental 
health status, which can delay effective treatment (Ben-Zeev and Young, 2010). Moreover, there is a 
stark shortage of mental health professionals—approximately nine psychiatrists per 100,000 people in 
high-income countries and merely 0.1 per million in low-income regions (Murray et al., 2012; Oladeji 
and Gureje, 2016). The recent global COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the critical importance 
of remote healthcare, particularly when access to traditional health services is limited (Bufano et al., 
2023; Santomauro et al., 2021). Consequently, there is a growing need for innovative, remote, and 
effective methods to monitor and manage depression and anxiety (Torous et al., 2020). 
 
Ubiquitous digital devices such as smartphones and wearables provide a cost-effective means to gather 
data on individual behaviours, physiological signals, and mood states, providing insights into daily 
human experiences (Mohr et al., 2017; Torous et al., 2016). Digital phenotyping has emerged as an 
innovative approach that leverages data from these digital devices to characterise behaviours and health 
conditions (Insel, 2017; Mohr et al., 2020). This non-invasive, remote, and highly scalable approach has 
driven numerous mobile health (mHealth) studies for mental health, especially during the COVID-19 
pandemic (Anikwe et al., 2022; Huckins et al., 2020; Ueafuea et al., 2020; Zhong et al., 2023). Focusing 
specifically on depression and anxiety, these studies collected real-world data to explore indicators 
related to these prevalent disorders, with some leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms to 
predict their severity (Abd-Alrazaq et al., 2023; De Angel et al., 2022; Rohani et al., 2018). Notably, 
passive measurements of behavioural and physiological patterns, including sleep routines, physical 
activity levels, and heart rate variability, have shown significant associations with depression and anxiety 
(Chalmers et al., 2014; De Angel et al., 2022; Moshe et al., 2021; Okobi et al., 2023). This evolving field 
holds the potential to transform mental health management by integrating continuous, objective data 
analysis into preventive and therapeutic strategies. 
 
Despite these advancements, these studies had several limitations, including the use of small to medium 
datasets (De Angel et al., 2022) and homogeneous or specific populations (e.g., college students (Wang 
et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2023)). This limits the generalizability of their findings and may be the reason for 
some inconsistent results reported in different cohorts (Currey and Torous, 2022; De Angel et al., 2022; 
Rohani et al., 2018). Furthermore, the performance of machine learning models varied across datasets, 
and their broader applicability remains uncertain (Abd-Alrazaq et al., 2023; De Angel et al., 2022). Given 
that the prevalence of depression and anxiety varies across demographics (Akhtar-Danesh and Landeen, 
2007; Bayram and Bilgel, 2008) and is influenced by factors such as physical comorbidities (Cimpean 
and Drake, 2011) and mood fluctuations (van Rijsbergen et al., 2013), there is a critical need for more 
comprehensive investigations of the indicators related to these conditions and testing the feasibility of 
machine learning prediction models in large-scale general populations.  
 
The present study used a cross-sectional design and analysed data from a large-scale mHealth dataset 

 
4
encompassing over 10,000 participants from a general UK-based population (Stewart et al., 2021). This 
study aimed to (1) identify indicators of depression and anxiety through wearable-derived features, 
demographic data, health metrics like body mass index (BMI), and mood assessments, and (2) evaluate 
the feasibility of using these features to predict the severity of depression and anxiety through machine 
learning techniques and interpret the impact of different modal features on prediction outcomes. 
 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1 Dataset 
This work analysed data from a large-scale observational mHealth study, Covid Collab, in which 17,667 
participants self-enrolled between June 2020 and August 2022 via the study smartphone app (Stewart et 
al., 2021). While the app was available globally, the majority of participants (95%) were recruited from 
within the UK (Stewart et al., 2024). Participants shared their Fitbit wearable data through the RADAR-
base, an open-source mHealth platform (Ranjan et al., 2019). They were also encouraged to regularly 
complete questionnaires related to mental health, mood, and COVID-19 symptoms via smartphone. 
Details of the study procedures and data collection are described in the study's protocol (Stewart et al., 
2021). The Covid Collab study received ethical approval from the King's College London’s PNM 
Research Ethics Panel (LRS-18/19-8662), with participants providing electronic consent through the 
study app.  
 
2.2 Measures 
2.2.1 Depression and anxiety assessments 
Participants’ depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed biweekly using the smartphone-conducted 
eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8 (Kroenke et al., 2009)) and seven-item Generalized 
Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7 (Spitzer et al., 2006)). The total scores on these assessments could range up 
to 24 and 21 respectively, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. PHQ-8 and GAD-7 are 
commonly used self-reported questionnaires for rapid screening depression and anxiety (Kroenke et al., 
2009; Spitzer et al., 2006). 
 
2.2.2 Baseline variables: demographic and health factors 
This study considered various demographic variables including age, ethnicity, employment status, 
marital status, and living situation. Health variables included BMI, physical comorbidities, and recent 
COVID-19 infections (diagnosed over the past week, month, and three months). These variables were 
collectively referred to as “baseline variables” throughout the rest of this paper. 
 
2.2.3 Mood variables 
Participants’ mood was assessed twice weekly through a simple task within the study app, where 
participants rated their daily Arousal (from -1 for tiredness to 1 for wakefulness) and Valence (from -1 
for displeasure to 1 for pleasure) using a sliding button. Mood variables closest to the date prior to each 
PHQ-8 and GAD-7 assessment were selected due to varying participation rates. 
 
2.2.4 Fitbit features 
Fitbit data was processed in two steps: daily feature extraction and biweekly feature aggregation. Daily 

 
5
features included sleep metrics (e.g., duration, onset, and offset times), activity metrics (e.g., caloric 
consumption, durations of active and sedentary periods), step metrics (e.g., total steps, and statistics of 
hourly steps), and heart rate metrics (e.g., hourly statistics and heart rate during activity). In addition to 
extracting features over the entire day, we also divided each day into four time periods and extracted 
features for each of them: night (00:00-06:00), morning (06:00-12:00), afternoon (12:00-18:00), and 
evening (18:00-24:00). To link participants’ behavioural and physiological characteristics with 
depression and anxiety assessments, we calculated the mean and standard deviation of daily features over 
the 14 days preceding each PHQ-8/GAD-7 assessment. In total, 46 aggregated biweekly features were 
extracted (detailed in Supplementary Table 1). The supplementary methods section provides a detailed 
description of the feature extraction process. 
 
2.3 Data inclusion criteria  
Based on our previous research, to ensure the quality of features, we only extracted daily features if the 
day's missing rate was less than 20%, and calculated aggregated biweekly features if at least eight days 
of valid daily data were available within the 14 days preceding each assessment (Sun et al., 2023; Zhang 
et al., 2024b). The inclusion criteria for PHQ-8 and GAD-7 assessments in this study were as follows: 
(1) completeness, i.e., all sub-questions were answered; (2) at least one type of aggregated biweekly 
feature (sleep, activity, step, or heart rate) was extracted; and (3) for participants with multiple 
assessments, we selected the first that met the previous two criteria for the cross-sectional study design. 
 
2.4 Association analysis 
Associations between the extracted variables and PHQ-8/GAD-7 scores were examined using the 
Kruskal-Wallis test (Ostertagova et al., 2014) for categorical variables, and the Spearman correlation 
coefficient (Spearman, 1961) for continuous variables. The Benjamini-Hochberg method (Benjamini and 
Hochberg, 1995) was used for multiple comparison correction. 
 
2.5 Clustering analysis 
We conducted an unsupervised clustering analysis on the extracted biweekly Fitbit features to explore 
different behavioural and physiological patterns among participants and their links with depression and 
anxiety. In contrast to bivariate association analysis, clustering enables the examination of relationships 
between multiple feature combinations and mental health outcomes. Initially, mean imputation and 
standardization were conducted for data preprocessing. Subsequently, principal component analysis 
(PCA) was performed for dimensionality reduction, which transformed the original features into 
principal components (PCs) representing linear combinations of these features (Granato et al., 2018). 
PCs were selected for clustering analysis until the cumulative explained variance exceeded 80%. To 
achieve robust and stable clustering results, K-means clustering (Syakur et al., 2018) was executed 500 
times with selected PCs, using the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters (k). This 
approach utilized different centroid seeds and selected clustering results with the lowest within-cluster 
sum of squares for the final output. After clustering, PHQ-8 and GAD-7 scores were compared across 
the identified clusters to discern patterns associated with the severity of depression and anxiety.

2.6 Prediction models  
We aimed to predict the severity of depression and anxiety for “new participants” (those not included 
during the training phase). The XGBoost model was chosen for its robustness in handling non-linear 
relationships and missing data (Chen and Guestrin, 2016). We developed separate prediction models for 
depression and anxiety, using the PHQ-8 or GAD-7 scores as the outcomes respectively, with extracted 
features as predictors. Note, due to the high correlation between depression and anxiety, and them both 
being derived from questionnaire data, we avoided using GAD-7 to predict PHQ-8 and vice versa. The 
data were split into a 70% training set and a 30% test set, stratified by age, gender, and PHQ-8/GAD-7 
scores to ensure similar distributions between the sets. Parameter tuning was performed via 5-fold cross-
validation on the training set, and predictions were made on the unseen test data. The coefficient of 
determination (R²) and mean absolute error (MAE) were used for model evaluation. Additionally, the 
SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method (Lundberg and Lee, 2017) was utilized to interpret 
feature importance and their impact on the predictions for PHQ-8 and GAD-7 scores. We tested model 
performance across all features and then conducted an ablation study to assess the predictive power of 
each category of features (baseline variables, mood variables, and Fitbit features). To minimize random 
bias, all models were repeated 50 times with different random seeds. 
 
3. Results 
3.1 Data overview 
Our analysis included 10,129 participants selected based on the data inclusion criteria. The selected 
cohort had a median (IQR) age of 48.0 years (36.0-58.0), with 7,008 (69.3%) participants being female. 
The median PHQ-8 score was 6.0 (2.0-10.0), and the median GAD-7 score was 4.0 (1.0-8.0). Detailed 
demographic information is available in Table 1.  
 
3.2 Associations of depression and anxiety with extracted variables 
Significant differences in depression and anxiety scores were observed across various baseline variables. 
PHQ-8 and GAD-7 scores decreased with increasing age, with the 18-30 age group reporting median 
(IQR) scores of 9.0 (5.0–14.0) for PHQ-8 and 7.0 (4.0–13.0) for GAD-7, and the 70+ age group reporting 
scores of 3.0 (1.0–6.0) and 1.0 (0.0–4.0) for PHQ-8 and GAD-7 (Figure 1a; p < 0.001). Gender 
differences revealed that female participants exhibited higher median PHQ-8 and GAD-7 scores of 6.0 
(3.0–11.0) and 5.0 (2.0–9.0) respectively, than males (PHQ-8: 4.0 [2.0–8.0]; GAD-7: 3.0 [0.0–6.0]) 
(Figure 1b; p < 0.001). When examining BMI, underweight and obese categories showed higher PHQ-8 
scores of 9.5 (3.25–15.0) and 8.0 (4.0–13.0), compared to those in the normal (5.0 [2.0–9.0]) and 
overweight (5.0 [2.0–9.0]) groups, with the underweight group also reporting the highest GAD-7 scores 
across BMI categories (7.5 [3.0–12.75]) (Figure 1c; p < 0.001). Employment status analysis revealed 
lower depression and anxiety scores in retired (PHQ-8: 3.0 [1.0-7.0]; GAD-7: 1.0 [0.0-5.0]) and 
employed participants (PHQ-8: 6.0 [3.0-11.0]; GAD-7: 4.0 [1.0-8.0]), compared to higher scores in 
unemployed participants (PHQ-8: 10.0 [5.0-16.25]; GAD-7: 7.0 [3.0-13.0]) and students (PHQ-8: 10.5 
[6.0-15.0]; GAD-7: 8.0 [4.0-12.0]) (Figure 1d; p < 0.001). Additionally, several other baseline variables 
such as marital status, living situation, ethnicity, and comorbidities were significantly correlated with 
PHQ-8 and GAD-7 scores, though some associations showed modest effect sizes, and others involved 
categories with limited sample sizes. Detailed results of all baseline variables are shown in 

 
7
Supplementary Table 2. 
 
Our Spearman correlation analysis highlighted a strong positive relationship between PHQ-8 and GAD-
7 scores, with a Spearman correlation coefficient (ρ) of 0.79. Mood variables Valence and Arousal scores 
negatively correlated with both PHQ-8 (Valence: ρ=-0.51, Arousal: ρ=-0.49) and GAD-7 (Valence: ρ
=-0.46, Arousal: ρ=-0.40). The PHQ-8 score exhibited negative correlations with variables related to 
steps (e.g., daily step counts [ρ=-0.24]) and activity (e.g., high activity duration [ρ=-0.22]) while showing 
positive correlations with variables rated to heart rates (e.g., nighttime heart rate [ ρ=0.24]), and 
variability in sleep (e.g., sleep duration variability [ρ=0.23]). The GAD-7 score displayed similar but 
generally weaker correlations with Fitbit features compared to PHQ-8. Notably, the top three Fitbit 
features correlated with GAD-7 were all related to heart rate. Figure 2 respectively presents the top 20 
variables correlated with PHQ-8 and GAD-7 and details of all correlations are shown in Supplementary 
Tables 3 and 4. 
 
3.3 Clustering patterns associated with depression and anxiety severity 
After dimensionality reduction through PCA (Figure 3a), K-means clustering identified three distinct 
clusters of Fitbit features (Figure 3b), primarily distinguished by the values of the first two PCs. PC1 is 
positively correlated with activity levels, while PC2 is correlated with heart rate levels, as indicated by 
the loadings of the original features (Figure 3a). Cluster 1 is characterized by participants with low 
activity and high heart rates, Cluster 2 by those with low activity and low heart rates, and Cluster 3 by 
high activity levels. Significant differences in PHQ-8 and GAD-7 scores were observed across these 
clusters (Figure 3c, p<0.001). Specifically, Cluster 1 participants reported the highest median scores 
(PHQ-8: 8.0 [4.0-13.0] and GAD-7: 6 [3.0-11.0]), followed by Cluster 2 (PHQ-8: 5.0 [2.0-10.0] and 
GAD-7: 4.0 [1.0-8.0]), with Cluster 3 presenting the lowest scores (PHQ-8: 4.0 [2.0-8.0] and GAD-7: 
3.0 [1.0-7.0]). 
 
3.4 Model performance for predicting depression and anxiety severity 
The performance of XGBoost prediction models with different feature sets on the test data is displayed 
in Figures 4a and 4b. For PHQ-8 predictions, the model incorporating all features performed best 
(R2=0.41, MAE=3.42); using only Fitbit, baseline, or mood features resulted in R2 values of 0.15, 0.15, 
and 0.31 and MAEs of 4.19, 4.17, and 3.70, respectively; combinations of Fitbit and baseline features, 
Fitbit and mood features, and baseline and mood features yielded R2 values of 0.22, 0.37, and 0.38 and 
MAEs of 3.98, 3.53, and 3.51, respectively. For GAD-7 predictions, the model with all features also had 
the highest performance (R2=0.31, MAE=3.50); using only Fitbit, baseline, or mood features led to R2 
values of 0.08, 0.12, and 0.24 and MAEs of 4.13, 4.00, and 3.70, respectively; combinations of Fitbit and 
baseline features, Fitbit and mood features, and baseline and mood features achieved R2 values of 0.14, 
0.27, and 0.31 and MAEs of 3.93, 3.63, and 3.50, respectively. 
 
Figures 4c and 4d visualize the impact of the top important features on the PHQ-8 and GAD-7 predictions. 
Key features in both models include Valence, Arousal, age, BMI, timing and variability of sleep, step 
cadence, and heart rate during the evening. The number of days with long sleep duration (potential 
hypertension), step count during the whole day and morning, and variability in step counts significantly 
influence the PHQ-8 predictions, whereas more heart rate-related features impacted GAD-7 predictions. 

 
8
Notably, SHAP values illustrate a nonlinear relationship with daily steps for PHQ-8 predictions, where 
both extremely high and relatively low step counts are associated with higher PHQ-8 scores. 
 
4. Discussion 
This study explored indicators for depression and anxiety through digital phenotyping, analysing real-
world gathered wearable and questionnaire data of 10,129 participants from a UK-based general 
population. Significant relationships were identified between depression and anxiety scores and various 
factors including mood, demographics, health metrics, and wearable-derived behavioural and 
physiological features. Machine learning models leveraging these variables can explain approximately 
41% of the variance in depression scores and 31% in anxiety scores. These results highlight the potential 
of these variables as indicators for depression and anxiety and demonstrate the feasibility of using digital 
phenotyping to manage mental disorders in large, real-world populations. 
 
The mood variables, Valence and Arousal, are negatively correlated with the severity of depression and 
anxiety, aligning with prior research that links lower levels of wakefulness and happiness to more severe 
symptoms (Moshe et al., 2021). Prediction models that incorporate only these two variables can explain 
31% of the variance in PHQ-8 scores and 24% in GAD-7 scores (Figure 4a), highlighting the substantial 
impact of mood on predictions of depression and anxiety. These variables can be easily collected through 
simple smartphone-conducted mood tasks, such as using sliding buttons. 
 
Both association analysis and SHAP values from prediction models demonstrated that age, gender, and 
BMI can be reliable indicators of depression and anxiety. Younger and female participants reported 
higher severity, consistent with research indicating a higher prevalence of depression and anxiety among 
younger individuals and women (Akhtar-Danesh and Landeen, 2007; Leach et al., 2008). Moreover, 
underweight and obese participants showed increased severity of depression, supporting epidemiological 
findings of a U-shaped relationship between depression and BMI (De Wit et al., 2009). This correlation 
may be influenced by biological factors, psychological stress, and lifestyle factors such as eating 
disorders and activity levels (De Wit et al., 2009). Inclusion of demographic and health variables in 
prediction models also significantly improved their overall performance, underscoring the importance of 
collecting this information of participants in the enrolment of future mHealth research. 
 
Behavioural and physiological features extracted from commercial wearable devices also show 
significant correlations with depression and anxiety. Specifically, greater variability in sleep patterns and 
later sleep timings (i.e., onset and offset) are associated with higher depression severity, consistent with 
findings from previous mobile health studies (Fang et al., 2021; Robillard et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 
2021a). For activity and step features, higher depression severity correlates with reduced activity duration, 
fewer steps, and slower step cadence, supporting past mHealth research (De Angel et al., 2022; 
McKercher et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2022b). Increased activity, caloric consumption and steps during 
nighttime, and a delayed peak time of steps, indicating poor sleep and disrupted circadian rhythms, were 
associated with higher depression severity, as reported by previous studies (Smagula et al., 2018; Zhang 
et al., 2024b). Regarding heart rate features, depression severity is positively correlated with night-time 
heart rate and daily minimum heart rate, and negatively correlated with the range and variation of daily 
heart rate, consistent with previous studies (Schwerdtfeger and Friedrich-Mai, 2009; Siddi et al., 2023). 
Elevated nighttime and minimal daily heart rates are indicators of poor sleep (Alvaro et al., 2013), while 

 
9
the increased range and variation of daily heart rate can reflect more physical activities and better sleep 
(Alvaro et al., 2013; Kandola et al., 2019). For anxiety, similar associations have been observed, 
potentially due to the frequent comorbidity of depression and anxiety (ρ=0.79; Figure 2) (Tiller, 2012). 
Future randomized controlled trials are needed to explore unique indicators for anxiety and depression 
separately. Past clinical studies have closely linked anxiety disorders with heart rate variability (Chalmers 
et al., 2014), and our findings corroborate this, with many heart rate-related features ranking highly in 
the Spearman coefficients (Figure 2b) and the importance for predicting GAD-7 scores (Figure 4d). In 
addition, clustering analysis indicated the complex interplay of behavioural and physiological factors 
influencing depression and anxiety severity. Specifically, lower activity levels combined with higher 
heart rates are associated with more severe symptoms of depression and anxiety, while higher activity 
levels correspond to lower severity. These findings highlight the importance of integrating multimodal 
features to uncover nuanced relationships that may not be immediately apparent from unimodal analyses 
(e.g., not all low-activity patterns predict higher severity). SHAP values from the prediction model 
(Figure 4c) also illustrate the nonlinear relationships between some behavioural features and mental 
disorders, such as daily steps and sleep. This helps explain inconsistencies found in previous smaller 
studies (De Angel et al., 2022; Rohani et al., 2018) and highlights the necessity of using nonlinear models 
to capture complex relationships. 
 
The results of the prediction models indicated that the best predictions for depression and anxiety severity 
were obtained by integrating mood, demographics and health data, along with behavioural and 
physiological features collected from wearable devices. When relying solely on Fitbit features, the 
models accounted for 15% and 8% of the variance in PHQ-8 and GAD-7 scores, respectively. This 
indicates that while certain Fitbit features are significantly associated with these disorders, their 
predictive effectiveness is limited. Previous mobile health studies have also reported limited predictive 
effectiveness when relying solely on passive features in cross-sectional predictions (Langholm et al., 
2023; Pratap et al., 2019). This limitation is partly due to the influence of non-psychological factors such 
as work schedules, illness, and other life events (e.g., holidays) on individuals' behaviours and physiology, 
which can introduce bias into the predictions. Furthermore, the diverse manifestations of mental 
disorders (e.g., both insomnia and hypersomnia are manifestations of depression) and individual 
differences (e.g., average heart rate varies across individuals) can impact the performance of prediction 
models, indicating the need of individual modelling. Our ablation analysis underscored the improved 
performance of models when incorporating a variety of data types, highlighting the necessity of a 
multimodal approach for effective mental health prediction. Future research could consider adding other 
modalities associated with mental health, such as speech (Zhang et al., 2024a) and passive phone data 
(e.g., GPS (Zhang et al., 2022a), Bluetooth (Zhang et al., 2021b), and accelerometers (Zhang et al., 
2022b)). However, it is also crucial to adapt the number of acceptable modalities based on varying 
degrees of user burden, to ensure maximum prediction accuracy and participant engagement in future 
studies. 
 
This study has several limitations. Firstly, the data were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic, which 
may have introduced biases (Stewart et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2020) despite including some pandemic-
related covariates; thus, our results need to be validated in post-pandemic datasets. Secondly, only a 
subset of demographic and health information (age, gender, and BMI) was initially collected at enrolment, 
with other variables gathered via an extended questionnaire. Due to participant attrition and engagement 

 
10
issues, we lost this information for some participants. Thirdly, to maintain interpretability, we used 
aggregated biweekly features in our machine learning models, potentially losing some day-to-day 
information. Future research will explore the use of daily features or raw data through sequential deep 
learning techniques to enhance prediction performance.  
5. Conclusion 
In conclusion, this study identified significant associations between depression and anxiety with mood, 
demographics, health metrics, and wearable-derived features in a large-scale UK-based general 
population. It also demonstrated the feasibility of using digital phenotyping and machine learning models 
to predict the self-reported severity of these disorders. Our findings highlight the benefit of integrating 
multiple data sources to enhance model performance, underscoring the importance of a multimodal 
approach for predicting mental health status. Despite some limitations, this research provides a 
foundational basis for future clinical applications using digital phenotyping approaches.
